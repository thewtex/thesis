High Frequency Phantom Characterization
=======================================

Next, we describe methods to characterize the acoustic properties of
high-frequency reference phantoms necessary to generate parametric images.
Recently, Madsen et al. [Madsen2010]_ developed tissue-mimicking (TM) phantoms
with ultrasonic properties of human arteries at very high frequencies
[Lockwood1991]_.  Accurate characterization of the acoustic properties of these new
phantoms pose additional challenges relative to the same characterization at
lower frequencies.  In this chapter, we describe the methods applied to
characterization of these phantoms.  Methods to determined the attenuation
coefficient, phase velocity, and absolute backscatter coefficient are described.
