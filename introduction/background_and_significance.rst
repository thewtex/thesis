Human Health Significance
=========================


In this chapter we describe the role diagnostic medical ultrasound plays in 
addressing the public health needs related to diagnosis of plaque burden in the carotid artery that predispose a patient to a stroke. 
Specifically, we focus on stroke due to carotid atherosclerotic disease with increased vessel stenosis or embolization being primary causative factors. 
First, we describe the prevalence and pathology of stroke. 
Next, we describe the current role of medical ultrasound clinically in carotid plaque detection and characterization. 
We review previous research efforts to improve carotid examination. 
The literature on high frequency ultrasonic characterization of carotid plaques is also described.  
Finally, the use of transcranial Doppler ultrasound for monitoring microembolic events in the middle cerebral artery is presented. 



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Etiology of stroke and the role of atherosclerotic plaque
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stroke is a disease that effects the most defining and critical organ of the human body, the brain. 
Stroke is a result of prolonged hypoxia to neural tissue resulting in cell death. 
Symptoms include compromised movement, speech, cognition, and death. 
Location and extent of neuron injury determine the resulting neuronal dysfunction.
While stroke is an acute ischemic cerebrovascular event with long lasting effects, there are similar ischemic pathologies with different time-courses. 
Transient ischemic attacks, TIA, usually last from 2-15 minutes. 
They result in cerebral impairment that subsides in under twenty-four hours [Whisnant1990]_. 
In addition, there also may be chronic ischemic events resulting from microemboli that explains some dementias due to the vascular cognitive impairment [Whisnant1990]_.  
Furthermore, a correlation between migraine and ischemic stroke has led to the suggestion that embolic ischemia may increase migraine risk [Zotto2008,Agostoni2007,Schoenen2006]_.

The pathogenesis of stroke is classified into four categories [Whisnant1990]_: brain hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage from an arteriovenous malformation, and brain infarction, which is also referenced as *ischemic stroke*. 
Mechanisms of cerebral infarction are further divided into subcategories, namely, thrombotic, embolic, and hemodynamic.  
Thrombotic infarction usually occurs with a thrombosis that forms around an atherosclerotic plaque.
This will occasionally occur with the larger cerebral arteries with extensive cerebrovascular disease. 

Emboli causing brain infarction can have many origins.  
One source of emboli is the heart.
Cardioembolic stroke can be due to many conditions. 
Atrial fibrillation, recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, valve disease or mechanical valve replacement can result in thrombosis with free passage to the brain.  
Stroke that was previously labeled idiopathic, paradoxical, or crypotogenic, is now thought to be primarily caused by a patent foramen ovale (PFO).  
A PFO occurs when the shunt in the fetus's atrial septum, for bypassing circulation to the lungs, fails to close after birth.  
There can be a clot within the shunt or a peripheral venous thrombus that has bypassed the lungs. [Whisnant1990]_
Finally, hemodynamic brain infarctions refer to hypoperfusion due to plaque stenosis or occlusion.
The stroke pathogenesis targeted in the proposed work are emboli from carotid plaque.
This is one of the common causes of stroke, underlying over 50\% of strokes [Nikic2006,Rothwell2000]_ .

Carotid endarterectomy, CEA, is a surgery performed to reduce the risk of stroke from carotid atherosclerosis. 
It involves accessing the carotid in the neck near the carotid bulb. 
An incision is made longitudinally along the carotid, the plaque is scraped out, and the surgical site closed.  
CEA has been performed since 1954, and approximately one million surgeries have been performed between 1974 to 1985 [Barnett1998]_.  
Two large scale clinical trials were performed in the 1990s to test the safety and effectiveness of CEA, namely the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial, NASCET, and the Committee for the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study, ACAS [NASCET1991,ACAS1995,Barnett1998]_.
The metric for stroke risk used during the trials was the extent of stenosis. 
Severe stenosis, defined to be 70 to 99\%, demonstrated CEA has significant ipsilateral benefit over medical treatment alone.  
Stenosis from 50 to 69\% had a moderate reduction in stroke risk, and there was no significant statistical benefit for patients with stenosis less than 50\%.
It was estimated that for patients with 50 to 69\% stenosis, it took 15 surgeries to prevent one stroke in a five year period.  
Another study from the European Carotid Surgery Trial concluded that CEA was beneficial in only 16\% of patients with 70-99\% stenosis. [Rothwell1999]_

Surgical complications and costs has solicited increased specificity in the selection of CEA candidates.  
Most patients with significant carotid plaques are older and have other symptoms of cardiovascular disease, and the surgical risks must be weighed carefully.  
Yet, stroke is a widespread detriment to public health and increased sensitivity to stroke risk is desired for appropriate prophylactic treatments.  
In 2005, 780 thousand new cases of stroke occurred in the United States. [AHAStats2008]_  
There were 150 thousand deaths in the United States during 2004.
While mortality rates have decreased over the years, morbidity is a public health and financial burden because of the recovery and rehabilitation required. 
Around 5.8 million stroke survivors are alive today.
It is estimated that the direct medical costs in the United States due to stroke were \$43.7 billion dollars in 2008. [AHAStats2008]_
Therefore, the most effective method of addressing stroke is prevention.
The purpose of the proposed research are to develop methods to more effectively identify stroke risk from embolic carotid plaque.

Defining vulnerable plaque
==========================

Vulnerable plaque is defined as ''a plaque which has a high tendency to cause ischemic events due to cerebral emboli originating from a thrombus on the plaque surface or from plaque rupture.'' [Kwee2008]_
There have been many hypotheses presented on the property or properties that make a plaque vulnerable.  These include a large lipid necrotic core or intraplaque hemorrhage with thin overlying cap, inflammatory infiltrate, and other factors [Schroeder1996]_.

Stress concentrators have received exhaustive attention in the Materials Science and Engineering discipline because of their relationship to material failure.
They define a *stress concentration factor* to be [Hibbeler2000]_

.. texmath::  K = \frac{\sigma_{max}}{\sigma_{avg}}

The stress concentration factor, :texmath:`K`, is the maximum stress caused by the disturbance in uniformity, :texmath:`\sigma_{max}`, divided by the reference stress, :texmath:`\sigma_{avg}`.
This concept is relevant not only to industrial materials such as metals and ceramics, but biological tissues.
Morphologically, the appearance of ulceration is also associated with vulnerability [Groenholdt1999,Park1998]_.
Ulceration is an irregularity in the surface of the plaque.  
In addition to inducing stress concentrations, ulcers expose thrombogenic layers of the plaque and provide a surface for a thrombus to develop on.   
Neoangiogensis is the formation of small blood vessels from the vasa vasorum that results from large and complex atherogenesis [Lusby1982]_.
These small fissures in the plaque also create stress concentrations.  
Plaques that appear heterogeneous are also associated with amaurosis fugax, TIA, and stroke symptoms [Groenholdt1999,Langsfeld1989,Pedro2000]_.
Heterogeneity can cause stress concentrations due to material property distribution discontinuity, similarly to how ulcerations or neovascularization can cause stress concentrations due to morphological discontinuities.
Thrombus in the plaque is considered a risk for future rupture since it not only can result in mechanically weak conditions but also is a marker of previous rupture events.
Thrombus formation, healing, and remodeling can be an ongoing process in vulnerable plaques.


Chemical markers of inflammation are also associated with plaque instability [Kunte2008,Tan2008]_.
These markers are used for the justification and development of pharmacological treatments such as statins. 
These markers tag for macrophage infiltration, the presence of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and the presence of inflammation.  
Macrophage infiltration plays a role in plaque formation along with indicating an acute inflammatory response [Wasserman2002,Lendon1991]_.  
Buildup of lipids initiates in macrophages that distend until they cannot escape into the circulation, forming 'foam cells', and eventually lipid crystals.
Macrophages secrete proteolytic enzymes that weakens the extracellular matrix.
MMP-9 functions as an enzyme that breaks down the extracellular matrix [Loftus2000]_.
As such, it plays a role in weakening the plaque material, which can have a positive-feedback influence on the presence of MMP-9.
Smooth muscle cells usually produce extra-cellular collagen that strengthens, though it can also produce the elastases capesin S or K in diseased intima [Davies1993,Sukhova1998]_.


Finally, while all these factors can make plaques intrinsically vulnerable to rupture, rupture is caused by extrinsic hemodynamic forces [Schroeder1996,Wootton1999]_.
Cyclic hemodynamic pulse pressure has been associated with carotid plaque ulceration [Lovett2003]_.
However, this changes from patient to patient with hypertension, pulsatility, and turbulence influenced by the bifurcation and plaque morphology.
