In this chapter we describe the role diagnostic medical ultrasound plays in
addressing public health needs related to diagnosis of plaque burden in the
carotid artery that may predispose a patient to a stroke.  Specifically, we
focus on stroke due to carotid atherosclerotic disease with increased vessel
stenosis or embolization being primary causative factors.  First, we describe
the prevalence and pathology of stroke.  We describe the current status of
prevention and treatment measures.  We review current methods to access stroke
risk by describing these techniques, the physiological target they aim to
quantify, current status of development, and effectiveness.  In this chapter, we
focus primarily on imaging methods.  A thorough literature review describes
research efforts in medical ultrasound imaging for carotid plaque detection and
characterization.  Finally, we present the approach taken in this dissertation
in the context of prior research efforts.

Etiology of stroke and the role of atherosclerotic plaque
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stroke is a disease that effects the most defining and critical organ of the
human body, the brain.  Stroke is a result of prolonged hypoxia to neural tissue
resulting in cell death that can occur because of infarction, hemorrhage, or
subarachnoid hemorrhage [Whisnant1990]_.  Symptoms include compromised movement,
speech, cognition, and death.  Location and extent of neuronal injury determine
the resulting neuronal dysfunction.  While stroke is an acute ischemic
cerebrovascular event with long lasting effects, there are similar ischemic
cerebrovascular pathologies with different time-courses.  For example, transient
ischemic attacks (TIA), usually last from 2-15 minutes.  They result in cerebral
impairment that subsides in under twenty-four hours [Whisnant1990]_.  In
addition, there also may be chronic ischemic events resulting from microemboli
that explain some dementias due to vascular cognitive impairment
[Whisnant1990]_.  According to Hachinski et al., one in three people will
experience stroke or dementia, but twice as many individuals will incur
cognitive impairment to a lesser degree [Hachinski2006]_.  Hachinski reported on
the efforts of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
(NINDS) and the Canadian Stroke Network's (CSN) effort to create a standard way
to identify and report on the degree of cognitive impairment.  Vascular
cognitive impairment is likely to become a productive area of future research
since it has been a largely unrecognized detriment to human health.  Its
widespread presence and increasing importance to quality of life as life
expectancy continues to be prolonged cannot be understated
[Hachinski2006,Hennerici2004]_.  Recent evidence has emerged suggesting that
cerebral emboli may be a cause or accelerator for cognitive decline associated
with Alzheimer's [Purandare2006a,Purandare2006,Purandare2007]_.  Some
researchers have termed the Alzheimer's/vascular disease combination as 'mixed
dementia', and it has gained increased recognition as the cause of mild
cognitive impairment observed with aging
[Langa2004,Schneider2009,Deschaintre2009]_.  Mild cognitive impairment, which
may be a precursor to Alzheimer's,  is thought to occur in 10 to 20 percent of
the elderly.  Alzheimer's disease is one of the fastest growing causes of death
in the United States: the number of deaths per year increased by 47% from 2000
to 2006 [AAStats2009]_.  Furthermore, a correlation between migraine and
ischemic stroke has led to the suggestion that embolic ischemia may increase
migraine risk [Zotto2008,Agostoni2007,Schoenen2006]_.  For example, Jesurum et
al. [Jesurum2008]_ found that migraine with aura can be relieved when the source
of ischemia causing emboli, a right-to-left shunt via a patent foramen ovale
(PFO), is closed even partially with surgery. 

While the effects of stroke are far reaching, there are only a few basic causes.
The pathogenesis of stroke can be classified into four categories
[Whisnant1990]_, namely: brain hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracranial
hemorrhage from an arteriovenous malformation, and brain infarction, which is
also referenced as *ischemic stroke*.  Mechanisms of cerebral infarction are
further divided into subcategories, namely, thrombotic, embolic, and
hemodynamic.  Thrombotic infarction usually occurs with a thrombosis that forms
around an atherosclerotic plaque.  This can occur with the larger cerebral
arteries that possess extensive cerebrovascular disease. 

Emboli causing brain infarction can have many origins.  One source of emboli is
the heart.  Cardioembolic stroke can be due to many conditions.  Atrial
fibrillation, recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, valve
disease or mechanical valve replacement can result in thrombosis with free
passage to the brain.  Stroke that were previously labeled idiopathic,
paradoxical, or crypotogenic, are now thought to be primarily caused by a patent
foramen ovale (PFO).  A PFO occurs when the shunt in the fetus's atrial septum,
for bypassing circulation to the lungs, fails to close after birth.  A clot
within the shunt or a peripheral venous thrombus that has bypassed the lungs
could then find its way to cerebral tissue [Whisnant1990]_.  Finally,
hemodynamic brain infarctions refer to hypoperfusion due to plaque stenosis or
occlusion.  The stroke pathogenesis targeted in this work are emboli originating
from carotid plaque.  This is one of the more common causes of stroke,
underlying over 50% of strokes [Nikic2006,Rothwell2000]_.  The carotid artery is
the main conduit of blood to the brain.  In humans there is a left and right
common carotid artery (CCA) that bifurcates in the upper neck into the internal
carotid artery (ICA) and the external carotid artery (ECA).  The diameter of the
CCA is typical 0.5 mm although age and atherosclerosis can increase diameter
through remodeling [Eigenbrodt2006]_.  Large muscular arteries are prone to
develop atherosclerosis and areas of hemodynamic disturbance are inherently
susceptible to atherosclerosis, so plaque invariably develops around the
bifurcation at the carotid bulb.

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA), is a surgery performed to reduce the risk of
stroke from carotid atherosclerosis.  It involves accessing the carotid in the
neck near the carotid bulb.  An incision is made longitudinally along the
carotid, the plaque is scraped out, and the surgical site closed.  CEA has been
performed since 1954, and approximately one million surgeries have been
performed between 1974 to 1985 [Barnett1998]_.  Two large scale clinical trials
were performed in the 1990s to test the safety and effectiveness of CEA, namely
the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET), and the
Committee for the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS)
[NASCET1991,ACAS1995,Barnett1998]_.  The metric for stroke risk used during the
trials was the extent of stenosis.  In patients with severe stenosis, defined to
be 70 to 99%, the results demonstrated that CEA had significant ipsilateral
benefit over medical treatment alone.  However, stenosis from 50 to 69% had a
moderate reduction in stroke risk, and there was no significant statistical
benefit for patients with stenosis less than 50%.  It was estimated that for
patients with 50 to 69% stenosis, it took 15 surgeries to prevent one stroke in
a five year period.  Another study from the European Carotid Surgery Trial
concluded that CEA was beneficial in only 16% of patients with 70-99% stenosis.
[Rothwell1999]_

Surgical complications and costs also solicit increased specificity in the
selection of CEA candidates.  In general, CEA has low rates of death and
morbidity, but patients with a history of tobacco use, substantial angina,
contralateral occlusion, or preoperative TIA have elevated risk of complications
[Duncan2008]_.  Most patients with significant carotid plaques are older and
have other symptoms of cardiovascular disease, and the surgical risks must be
weighed carefully.  Yet, stroke is a widespread detriment to public health and
increased sensitivity to stroke risk is desired for appropriate prophylactic
treatments.  The risk factors for stroke are well known and include diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, coronary heart disease, tobacco use, large
artery disease, atrial fibrillation, patent foramen ovale or atrial septal
defect, and cervical artery dissection [Arnold2008]_.  In 2005, 780 thousand new
cases of stroke occurred in the United States. [AHAStats2008]_  There were 150
thousand deaths in the United States during 2004.  While mortality rates have
decreased over the years, morbidity is a public health and financial burden
because of the recovery and rehabilitation required.  Around 5.8 million stroke
survivors are alive today.  It is estimated that the direct medical costs in the
United States due to stroke were $43.7 billion dollars in 2008. [AHAStats2008]_
Therefore, the most effective method of addressing stroke is prevention.  The
purpose of the proposed research is to develop methods to more effectively
identify and stratify stroke risk from embolic carotid plaque.

Vulnerable plaque
=================

Vulnerable plaque is defined as ''a plaque which has a high tendency to cause
ischemic events due to cerebral emboli originating from a thrombus on the plaque
surface or from plaque rupture.'' [Kwee2008]_  There have been many hypotheses
presented on the property or properties that make a plaque vulnerable.  These
include a large lipid necrotic core or intraplaque hemorrhage with a thin
overlying fibrous cap, inflammatory infiltrate, and other factors
[Schroeder1996]_.

Morphologically, the appearance of ulceration is also associated with plaque
vulnerability [Groenholdt1999,Park1998]_.  Ulceration is an irregularity in the
surface of the plaque.  In addition to inducing stress concentrations,
ulcerations expose thrombogenic layers of the plaque and provide a surface for a
thrombus to develop on.  Another factor that can lead to increased plaque
vulnerability is angiogenesis.  Neoangiogensis refers to the formation of small
blood vessels from the vasa vasorum that result from large and complex
atherogenesis [Lusby1982]_.  These small fissures in the plaque also create
additional stress concentrations.  Plaques that appear heterogeneous in
composition as indicated by ultrasound B-Mode echogenicity are also associated
with amaurosis fugax, TIA, and stroke symptoms
[Groenholdt1999,Langsfeld1989,Pedro2000]_.  Heterogeneity can cause stress
concentrations due to material property distribution discontinuity, similarly to
how ulcerations or neovascularization can cause stress concentrations due to
morphological discontinuities.  Thrombus in the plaque is considered a risk for
future rupture since it not only can result in mechanically weak conditions but
also is a marker of previous rupture events.  Thrombus formation, healing, and
remodeling can be an ongoing process in vulnerable plaques.

Chemical markers of inflammation are also associated with plaque instability
[Kunte2008,Tan2008]_.  These markers are used for the justification and development
of pharmacological treatments such as statins.  These markers tag for macrophage
infiltration, the presence of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and the presence
of inflammation.  Macrophage infiltration plays a role in plaque formation along
with indicating an acute inflammatory response [Wasserman2002,Lendon1991]_.  
Buildup of lipids initiates inside macrophages that distend until they cannot escape
into the circulation, forming 'foam cells', and eventually lipid crystals.
Macrophages secrete proteolytic enzymes that weaken the extracellular matrix.
MMP-9 functions as an enzyme that breaks down the extracellular matrix [Loftus2000]_.
As such, it plays a role in weakening the plaque material, which can have a
positive-feedback influence on the presence of MMP-9.  Smooth muscle cells usually
produce extra-cellular collagen that strengthens, though it can also produce the
elastases capesin S or K in diseased intima [Davies1993,Sukhova1998]_.

Finally, while all these factors can make plaques intrinsically vulnerable to
rupture, rupture is caused by extrinsic hemodynamic forces
[Schroeder1996,Wootton1999]_.  Cyclic hemodynamic pulse pressure has been
associated with carotid plaque ulceration [Lovett2003]_.  Hypertension, as
quantified with central systolic blood pressure, correlates with ischemia as
quantified with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI images, where
the white matter hyperintensities correlate independently from carotid plaque
score [Shrestha2009]_.  Hemodynamic forces vary from patient to patient with
hypertension, pulsatility, and turbulence influenced by the bifurcation and
plaque morphology.  

All these factors that have been intuitively been associated with plaque
vulnerability are explained formally by a quanitity arising from solid mechanics
models of the underlying physical behavior, local stress concentration.  Stress
concentrators have received exhaustive attention in the Materials Science and
Engineering discipline because of their relationship to material failure.  They
define a *stress concentration factor* to be [Hibbeler2000]_

.. texmath::  K = \frac{\sigma_{max}}{\sigma_{avg}}

The stress concentration factor, :texmath:`K`, is the maximum stress caused by
the disturbance in uniformity, :texmath:`\sigma_{max}`, divided by the reference
stress, :texmath:`\sigma_{avg}`.  This concept is relevant not only to
industrial materials such as metals and ceramics, but biological tissues.  


Plaque characterization with other methods and imaging modalities
=================================================================

Ultrasound is currently the most common method for plaque investigation because
it is noninvasive, easily accessible, and has a relatively low cost.  While most
prevalent clinically, other methods have a clinical and research role in
determining plaque vulnerability.  Histological classification of excised
plaques have shown that hemorrhage, ulceration, and lipid rich plaques have an
association with amaurosis fugax, TIA, or stroke. [Groenholdt1999]_ Fresh
thrombi especially have a connection with ischemic infarction. [Lusby1982]_
Also, as previously mentioned, inflammatory markers are also related to stroke
symptoms.

Computed Tomography
-------------------

Angiography is the current gold standard for quantifying stenosis, and the high
resolution is good for identifying ulcerations [NASCET1991,Saba2007]_.  Single
slice computed tomography (CT) has had limited success in carotid plaque
classification [Walker2002]_, but recently multidetector-row computed tomography
(MRCT) have attempted to quantify total plaque volume, calcification, fibrous,
and lipid or hemorrhage areas [Ajduk2008,Saba2008]_.  

Magnetic Resonance Imaging
--------------------------

High resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has better composition
determination capabilities than MRCT because of the increased soft tissue
contrast [Oikawa2009,Kwee2008,U-King-Im2008,Fabiano2008,Yarnykh2006,Saam2008]_.
This contrast is not only used to identify volume and degree of stenosis but
also provides a noninvasive method to identify components of lipid, fibrous,
calcium, or thrombus.  Relative to the surrounding muscle, calcium appears
hypointense on T\ :sub:`1`\ -weighted, very hypointense on proton-density
weighted, and very hypointense on T\ :sub:`2`\ -weighted images.  Lipids are very
hyperintense on T\ :sub:`1`\ -weighted, hypertense on proton-density weighted,
and hypointense on T\ :sub:`2`\ -weighted images.  Finally, fibrous tissue is
isointense to slightly hyperintense on all three parameter-weighted images.  T\
:sub:`1` shortening causing increased signal intensity is associated with the
protein-water interactions of the extracellular matrix content found in fibrous
tissue.  A short T\ :sub:`2`\ , which causes low signal intensity in T\
:sub:`2`\ -weighted images, is found in primarily lipid areas where there is
increased interaction between free and bound water.  The calcium areas will have
low signal intensity because of low proton density and diffusion-mediated
susceptibility effects.  [Fayad2001]_ The calcium susceptibility and
paramagnetic ferric iron in hemorrhage may alter atherosclerotic appearance in
3.0 T magnets slightly, but the general characteristics still apply from 1.5 T
magnets. [Underhill2008]_  In a study of *ex-vivo* plaque specimens, Fabiano et
al. found that 1.5-T MRI had sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 74% for
the lipid core, 82% and 94% for fibrous tissue, 72% and 87% for fibrous/loose
connective tissue, and 98% and 99% for calcifications [Fabiano2008]_.  The
quality of MRI images of the carotid bifurcation will continue to improve as
hardware, excitation sequences, and image processing is modified for this
application.  Balu et al. indicated a 1.7 fold improvement in SNR and larger
coverage with a 8 channel phased array coil at 3T [Balu2009]_.  In a study of 60
patients, high resolution MRI was able to detect greater plaque hemorrhage in
acute symptomatic vs. recently symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients [Sadat2009]_.
The application of black-blood MR imaging sequences increases the detection of
ulceration [Yu2009]_.  Even though MRI imaging of composition hold promise,
there is room for improvement: an attempt to correlate plaque morphology and
composition as measured on both arteries of 40 patients did not find that the
MRI images along could not predict the severity of white matter ischemia as
measured using FLAIR MRI images [Patterson2009]_.

Contrast can be further improved and neovascularization visualized with
contrast-enhanced MRI [Saam2007]_.  Since methemoglobin is associated with
thrombus and hemorrhage and with a shortening of T\ :sub:`1`\ , intraplaque
hemorrhage can be detected with MRI [Moody2003]_.  Another thrombus detecting
MRI agent is the fibrin targeted peptide EP-2104R. [Sirol2005]_ Thrombus age can
be inferred from T\ :sub:`1`\ -weighted or T\ :sub:`2`\ -weighted signal
intensity, although thrombus generally has better T\ :sub:`1` intensity.
[Corti2002]_ The gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent P947 MMPs may be a tool for
detecting plaque inflammation [Lancelot2008]_.

Nuclear imaging
---------------

Plaque inflammation is targeted in many of the newer nuclear imaging techniques
[Chen2005]_.  :sup:`18`\ F-FDG PET detects the increased glycolytic activity of
inflammatory cells. [Rominger2009,Tawakol2006,Rudd2002]_  SPECT imaging can be
performed to trace oxidized low density lipoproteins (\ :sup:`99m`\ Tc-LDL), or
apoptosis (\ :sup:`99m`\ Tc-annexin A5).
[Lees1988,Virgolini1992,Boersma2005,Kietselaer2004]_  Annovazzi et. al. have
attempted to use :sup:`99m`\ Tc-IL2 scintigraphy to detect chronic inflammatory
response indicated my T-cell and macrophage activation as a marker for Crohn's
disease [Annovazzi2003]_.  :sup:`111`\In platlet scintigraphy is sensitive to
thrombosis, but it cannot distinguish other tissue types [Manca2001]_.

Thermal
-------

Increased metabolic activity associated with inflammation can be detected with a
needle thermistor, although this requires interrogation with a catheter, which
is an invasive procedure.  Inflammation is associated with thrombosis generation
on both ruptured and non-ruptured surfaces [Casscells1996]_.  In a study of 50
CEA samples, Casscells et at. found that some plaques have focal regions that
are warmer by 0.4-2.2 ºC, and they can be very close to one another, less than 1
mm apart [Casscells1996]_.  Increased cell density correlated with macrophage
cell density and proximity to the luminal surface.  In general, the thermal
profile is heterogenous.  Temperture is also found to be higher in areas where
local pH is lower, and it is inversely correlated with smooth muscle cell
density [Madjid2002]_.

There are two methods to measure temperature variations *in vivo*: a thermistor
and infrared means.  A thermistor placed at the tip of a catheter must come into
direct contact with tissue's luminal surface.  An fiber-optic cable in a
catheter can transmit infrared energy indicating local temperature.  In both cases, blood
flow may redistribute local spikes in temperature [Kim2008]_.

Optical
-------

There have been a variety of optical techniques that have demonstrated
diagnostic capabilities, which measure various optical characteristics. Like
thermal methods, these methods require interrogation with a catheter because
they generally have lower penetration than the other imaging modalities.  On the
other hand, they have higher resolution than other modalities, which is
important for such small tissue volumes.

Intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a catheter based method that
provides limited penetration, but very high resolution, on the order of 10 μm
axially and 20 μm laterally [Yabushita2002]_.  Sensitivity and specificity rates
for composition classifcation range from 71% and 79% to 97% and 98%
[Yabushita2002]_.  Lipid and necrotic core have low optical attenuation, while
fibrous and calcified tissue have a higher attenuation [VanSoest2009]_.

Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy (TRFS) is another optical technique that
is used in conjunction with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)
[Stephens2009,Marcu2005]_.  Anatomical guidance is provided by IVUS which is
registered with the TRFS signal.  TRFS detects autofluorescence from elastic,
collagen, lipids, and by products of inflammatory processes to characterize the
local biochemical composition.

Raman spectroscopy is a method that measures the weak scattered signal from a
laser light that shifts in frequency due to interactions with characteristic
molecular vibrations and rotations [Hanlon2000]_.  Spectra provide a chemical
footprint of biomedical composition.  Recent developments of optical fiber
technology and small diameter probes with sufficient filtering capabilities
allows examination real-time *in vivo* acquisition [Motz2006]_.  The sensitivity
and specificity rates for determining carotid and femoral plaque composition
were found to be 79% and 85%, respectively [Motz2006]_.  Near-infrared (NIR)
spectroscopy is similar to Raman spectroscopy, but investigates the absorbance
at wavelengths from 400 to 2400 nm [Lerakis2008]_.  The defining characteristics
of tissue components in these situations can be determined empirically by
applying a histology-based training set on principle component analysis or other
methods to components of the spectra [Moreno2002]_.


Plaque characterization with diagnostic ultrasound
==================================================

B-Mode intensity and textural features
--------------------------------------

Vulnerability assessment with ultrasound focuses on many of the same parameters
examined using other modalities such as MRI.  Stenosis is currently assessed
with Doppler velocity measurements, along with color-flow and B-mode imaging.
After measuring peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, and pre and
post-stenotic ratios, a percent stenosis can be implied based on these
measurements [Koelemay1996,Wardlaw2006,Arbeille1999]_.  Many radiologists also
try to access the plaque through visual inspection of the B-mode images.
Echolucent plaque are considered more vulnerable because lipid and hemorrhage
are often echolucent.
[Groenholdt1997,Groenholdt1999,ECPSG1995,Pedro2000,Ohki1998,Polak1998]_ In
contrast, homogeneous calcification is thought to cause plaque stabilization
[Avril1991]_.  While calcified tissue is usually echogenic, fibrous plaque can
also be echolucent.  Additionally, shadowing and other effects can make
echogenicity difficult to interpret.  Nonetheless, echogenicity has been the
most commonly tested and most widely used metric of vulnerability.  Ultrasound
echogenicity is assessed via direct visual examination of B-mode images.  Some
authors prefer to use the Gray-Weale scale for echogenicity which stratifies
echogenicity into five types ranging from echolucent to calcific with shadowing
[Gray-Weale1988]_ A slight improvement to visual examination are
computer-assisted gray-scale median (GSM) measurements
[Sztajzel2005,Aly2000,Lal2002]_.  These results are semi-quantitative since they
rely on the settings and properties of the ultrasound scanning device.  Plaque
intensities are normalized to intraluminal blood and adventitia.  When the
definition of thresholds and regions of interest is forced and quantitative
intensity measurements are made, objectivity is increased [Lal2006]_.
Additionally, the quality of B-mode images have recently been improved with
angular compounding [Kern2004]_.  

More sophisticated analysis of B-mode properties focuses on factors other than
local intensity, broadly termed 'texture analysis'.  Texture analysis has the
aim of differentiating tissue composition and properties
[Christodoulou2003,Coleman2005,Lee1998,Madycki2006,Stoitsis2006]_.  Texture
analysis examines statistical parameters of the intensity, Fourier spectrum,
Wavelet Transform, or other quantities in a local area, and statistical
techniques are applied to empirically determine which parameters may
differentiate tissue composition.  In contrast, sophisticated analysis that
attempts to separate device dependent from tissue dependent effects on the image
is termed Ultrasonic Tissue Characterization (UTC).  There have been various
research efforts using parameters such as slope, intercept, and midband-fit of
the local backscatter spectra normalized by a reference spectra that aim to
differentiate plaque composition
[Wilson1994,Lockwood1991,Bridal1997a,Bridal2000,Waters2003,Sano2006,Watson2000,Noritomi1997,Nair2001,Spencer1997a,Katouzian2008,Wickline1993]_.
However, the poor effectiveness and difficulty of the data reduction methods
have limited clinical adoption.  Most attempts have been *in vitro* or
invasively collected with IVUS, although there have been a few recent attempts
with external ultrasound on *in vivo* human carotid
[Sareen2008,Shi2009,Urbani1993]_.  UTC on arterial plaque is discussed in detail
in the chapter on high frequency characterization of carotid plaque.


Morphologically, the appearance of ulceration is also associated with
vulnerability [Groenholdt1999]_.  Ulcerations are irregularities on the plaque surface.  
In a study monitoring patients over 6.2 years on 1,091 plaques, it was found that
these irregularities or ulcerations increased stroke risk with a 2.7:1 hazard ratio
[Prabhakaran2006]_.  Resolution and two dimensional imaging limitations with *in vivo*
ultrasound make it difficult to consistently evaluate ulceration.  It is more difficult
to detect ulceration for plaques with increased stenosis.  By comparing with results
from histology, it was found that for plaque with >50% stenosis, the sensitivity for
direct ulceration detection was only 41% [ECPSG1995]_.  However, the use of microbubble
contrast agents improve surface definition by increasing contrast at the lumen border
where it may be otherwise compromised by partial-volume effects [Kono2004]_.

Neoangiogenesis in large plaques also plays a role similar to ulceration as
mechanical stress concentrators.  Unlike surface ulcerations, neoangiogenesis
compromises the tissue at a deeper level, making large ruptures more likely.
These tiny vessels that were previously undetectable with ultrasound, and they
may now be visible under ultrasound imaging with contrast agents [Coli2008]_.

Radiofrequency signal based characterization
--------------------------------------------

todo

Strain imaging
--------------

The interaction of morphology, composition, and pulse pressures can lead to high stress
states, but the instability depends on mechanical system configuration as a whole
[Li2007a,Li2007,Li2008,Hatsukami1997,Imoto2005,Tang2005a,Groen2008]_.
P.D. Richardson performed 
seminal work examining this hypothesis, and he points out that rupture is a result of 
structural mechanics, fluid mechanics, plaque morphology, plaque micromechanical material properties, and MMPs [Richardson2002,Richardson1989]_.  For example, large lipid pools can
cause mechanical stresses, but these stresses are much more significant when the pool
is closer to the lumen [Lal2006,Bassiouny1997]_.  D.L. Tang has created 2D and 3D
fluid-structure interaction based finite element analysis using MRI and IVUS based
morphology and composition information [Tang2008,Yang2009]_.  From this model, vulnerability
is graded according to a computational plaque stress index based on the maximum
principal stress [Tang2009]_.  Tang's research has shown that plaque wall stress
was 126% higher in 5 ruptured plaques compared to 7 non-ruptured plaques for 12
patients that underwent CEA in one study and was found to have an 85% agreement
rate with histopathological analysis in a second study  [Tang2009a,Tang2005]_.  These studies also verify that
markers traditionally considered for vulnerability such as morphology and
composition also increase local stress/strain [Tang2005a]_.  Trivedi reached similar conclusions
in an MR imaging-based computational analysis of 5 symptomatic and 5
asymptomatic patients: principal shear stress was higher in symptomatic plaques
than in asymptomatic plaques [Trivedi2007]_.  Ulceration has observed to be more
common proximal to stenosis and more common for fatty plaques [Saba2007]_.  

Inflammation may be part of a positive feedback process where mechanical tearing
would stimulate a necrotic response that catabolizes the extracellular matrix,
leading to further mechanical weakness at the site
[Sirico2009,Lendon1993,Arroyo1999,Dhume2003,Ho2002,Lee1998,Lendon1991]_.  This
is supported by a recent study comparing gene expression in calcific areas,
often associated with stability, compared to non-calcific areas.  It was found
that gene expression of factors that promote interleukin 8 and monocyte
chemoattractant protein 1, associated with inflammation and thereby
vulnerability, were higher in non-calcified areas [Wahlgren2009]_.  Lee et al.
performed a mechanical finite element analysis simulation using the morphology
of 12 unruptured human coronary lesions and assumed appropriate mechanical
material properties for the tissue components.  When comparing images of
immunoreactive MMP-1, they found that high stress had twice the MMP-1 expression
as low stress regions [Lee1996]_.  Elevated levels of highly sensitive
C-reactive protein, another inflammation marker, correlates with increased
intima-media thickness [Benbir2005]_.  These high stress states may lead to
fatigue failure [Bank2000,Bauters2002,Cheng1993]_.

|holzapfel_intima| shows a tensile test performed by Holzapfel on diseased intima
sectioned from cadaver iliac arteries [Holzapfel2004]_.  
As the graph progresses from the origin, the stretch and stress is increased
on the tissue until the tissue fractures at the curve's termination.  The point
in the curve farthest from the origin defines the stretch at which failure occurs,
ultimate tensile stretch :texmath:`\lambda_{ult}`, and the stress at which failure
occurs, ultimate tensile stress, :texmath:`\sigma_{ult}`.

Recently, ultrasonic and MRI [Lin2008]_ strain imaging techniques have been
applied to imaging of the carotid arteries.  Strain imaging creates an *in vivo* map
of strain, a parameter directly related to tissue stretch or contraction, drawn
on the abscissa in |holzapfel_intima|.  Vulnerable plaques have a higher extensibility
and a lower ultimate stress [Lendon1991,Holzapfel2004]_.  Therefore, strain
imaging directly measures a parameter that determines how close a plaque is
to failure [Tang2005]_.  This contrasts with other characterization methods that
focus on parameters like composition, which may affect strain in a secondary manner
and may be system dependent as previously discussed.  Strain imaging directly measures
the effect of multiple stress concentrators including composition, ulceration, morphology,
neovascularization, and hemodynamics.  

Most of the initial arterial strain imaging studies were performed with IVUS by
de Korte
[deKorte1997,Carlier2002,Cespedes2000,Korte2000,Schaar2003,Wan2001,Maurice2008,Liang2008]_.
However, IVUS is invasive because catheterization is required.  Additionally,
catheter movement with blood flow can make it difficult to determine the
orientation of the transducer and to differentiate between catheter and artery
movement [DeKorte1999,Shi2005b]_.

A slightly different approach is thermal strain imaging, which has recently been
examined as a method for characterizing plaque composition [Shi2005,Kim2008b]_.
Strain in the ultrasound signal is a result of the tissue's coefficient of
thermal expansion and the change in sound speed that occurs with temperature.
Temperature changes on the order of 1º C can be detected [Shi2005]_.  The
temperature change is induced by microwave radiation or ultrasound energy
absorption.  In the study by Kim et al., ultrasound signal motion tracking with
a high frequency (50 MHz) transducer was employed to monitor ultrasound induced
thermal expansion on *in vitro* tissue [Kim2008b]_.  Yet, it remains to be seen
how this technique can be applied *in vivo* where tissue movement, from both
bula motion and mechanical strain, is significant [Shi2005a]_.  

More recently, strain imaging with external ultrasound imaging using linear
array transducers has been attempted
[Meairs1999,Bang2003,Brusseau2001,Dahl2004,Kanai2003,Maurice2005a,Maurice2004a,Maurice2005,Maurice2004,Ribbers2007,Stoitsis2005,Schmitt2007,Shi2008]_.
We give a detailed literature review of this area in the chapter that describes
the effectiveness of the novel motion tracking method.  While the resolution of
external ultrasound is much lower, it is noninvasive and appropriate for general
stroke risk screening purposes.  Even though strain imaging holds much promise
in the detection of vulnerable plaque, its success depends on the ability to
measure strain accurately, with a large dynamic range, and with minimal noise.
The research presented in this dissertation focuses on the development of improved
strain imaging algorithms and techniques and applies them to the diagnosis of
stroke risk due to carotid plaque disruption.
