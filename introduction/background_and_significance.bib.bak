The properties measured were propagation speed, attenuation coefficients, and backscatter coefficients. Reasonably good agreement exists for attenuation coefficients, but less satisfactory results were found for propagation speeds. As anticipated, agreement was not impressive in the case of backscatter coefficients. Results for four sites agreed rather well in both absolute values and frequency dependence, and results from other sites were lower by as much as an order of magnitude. The study is valuable for laboratories doing quantitative studies.},

@article{Madjid2002,
abstract = {In 1996, we showed that inflamed atherosclerotic plaques give off
more heat and that vulnerable plaques may be detected by measuring
their temperature. Plaque temperature is correlated directly with
inflammatory cell density and inversely with the distance of the
cell clusters from the luminal surface. It is inversely related to
the density of the smooth muscle cells. We found no significant association
between temperature heterogeneity and presence of Chlamydia pneumoniae
in plaque or the gross color of human atherosclerotic carotid plaques.
We also found pH heterogeneity in plaques from human carotid artery
and aortas of Watanabe atherosclerotic rabbits and apolipoprotein
E-deficient mice. Areas with lower pH had higher temperature, and
areas with a large lipid core showed lower pH with higher temperature,
whereas calcified regions had lower temperature and higher pH. We
also developed a thermography basket catheter and showed in vivo
temperature heterogeneity in atherosclerotic lesions of atherosclerotic
dogs and Watanabe rabbits. Thermal heterogeneity was later documented
in human atherosclerotic coronary arteries. Temperature difference
between atherosclerotic plaque and healthy vessel wall is related
to clinical instability. It is correlated with systemic markers of
inflammation and is a strong predictor of adverse cardiac events
after percutaneous interventions. Thermography is the first in a
series of novel "functional" imaging methods and is moving to clinical
trials. It may be useful for a variety of clinical and research purposes,
such as detection of vulnerable plaques and risk stratification of
vulnerable patients.},

abstract = {In this paper, we explore two parameters or strain indices related
to plaque deformation during the cardiac cycle, namely, the maximum
accumulated axial strain in plaque and the relative lateral shifts
between plaque and vessel wall under in vivo clinical ultrasound
imaging conditions for possible identification of vulnerable plaque.
These strain indices enable differentiation between calcified and
lipidic plaque tissue utilizing a new perspective based on the stiffness
and mobility of the plaque. In addition, they also provide the ability
to distinguish between softer plaques that undergo large deformations
during the cardiac cycle when compared to stiffer plaque tissue.
Soft plaques that undergo large deformations over the cardiac cycle
are more prone to rupture and to release micro-emboli into the cerebral
bloodstream. The ability to identify vulnerable plaque, prone to
rupture, would significantly enhance the clinical utility of this
method for screening patients. We present preliminary in vivo results
obtained from ultrasound radio frequency data collected over 16 atherosclerotic
plaque patients before these patients undergo a carotid endarterectomy
procedure. Our preliminary in vivo results indicate that the maximum
accumulated axial strain over a cardiac cycle and the maximum relative
lateral shift or displacement of the plaque are useful strain indices
that provide differentiation between soft and calcified plaques.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE--To assess the size of the lipid pool and the number of
smooth muscle cells and monocyte/macrophages in human aortic plaques
that were intact and to compare the results with those in aortic
plaques undergoing ulceration and thrombosis. DESIGN--The lipid pool
was measured as a percentage of the total cross sectional area of
the plaque. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify cell types
(monocytes/macrophages (M phi) by EBM11 and HAM56, smooth muscle
cells by alpha actin). The area of the tissue occupied by each cell
type was measured by quantitative microscopy in the peripheral (shoulder)
area of the plaque and the plaque cap. Absolute counts of each cell
type were expressed as the ratio of SMC:M phi. MATERIAL--Aortas were
obtained at necropsy from men aged less than 69 years who died suddenly
(within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms) of ischaemic heart disease.
155 plaques from 13 aortas were studied. Four aortas showed intact
plaques only (group A, n = 31). Nine aortas showed both intact plaques
(group B, n = 79) and plaques that were undergoing thrombosis (group
C, n = 45). RESULTS--In 41 (91.1\%) of the 45 plaques undergoing
thrombosis (group C) lipid pools occupied more than 40\% of the cross
sectional area of the plaque. Only 12 (10.9\%) of the 110 intact
plaques (groups A + B) had lipid pools of this size. The mean size
of the lipid pool in plaques of groups A, B, and C was 12.7\%, 27.3\%
and 56.7\% respectively. Compared with intact plaques those undergoing
thrombosis contained a smaller volume of smooth muscle cells (2.8\%
v 11.8\%) and a larger volume of monocyte/macrophages (13.7\% v 2.9\%)
in the plaque cap. The ratio of the number of smooth muscle cells
to monocytes/macrophages was 7.8 in group A plaques, 4.1 in group
B plaques, and 1.0 in group C plaques. This gradient was the result
of an absolute increase in monocyte/macrophages and an absolute decrease
in smooth muscle cells. CONCLUSIONS--In the aorta ulceration and
thrombosis were characteristic of plaques with a high proportion
of their volume occupied by extracellular lipid, and in which there
was a shift toward a preponderance of monocyte/macrophages compared
with smooth muscle cells in the cap.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an ex vivo human carotid artery stenting model
that can be used for the quantitative analysis of risk for embolization
associated with balloon angioplasty and stenting and to correlate
this risk with lesion characteristics to define lesions suitable
for balloon angioplasty and stenting. METHODS: Specimens of carotid
plaque (n = 24) were obtained circumferentially intact from patients
undergoing standard carotid endarterectomy. Carotid lesions were
prospectively characterized on the basis of angiographic and duplex
findings before endarterectomy and clinical findings. Specimens were
encased in a polytetrafluoroethylene wrap and mounted in a flow chamber
that allowed access for endovascular procedures and observations.
Balloon angioplasty and stenting were performed under fluoroscopic
guidance with either a Palmaz stent or a Wallstent endoprosthesis.
Ex vivo angiograms were obtained before and after intervention. Effluent
from each specimen was filtered for released embolic particles, which
were microscopically examined, counted, and correlated with various
plaque characteristics by means of multivariate analysis. RESULTS:
Balloon angioplasty and stenting produced embolic particles that
consisted of atherosclerotic debris, organized thrombus, and calcified
material. The number of embolic particles detected after balloon
angioplasty and stenting was not related to preoperative symptoms,
sex, plaque ulceration or calcification, or artery size. However,
echolucent plaques generated a higher number of particles compared
with echogenic plaques (p < 0.01). In addition, increased lesion
stenosis also significantly correlated with the total number of particles
produced by balloon angioplasty and stenting (r = 0.55). Multivariate
analysis revealed that these two characteristics were independent
risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Echolucent plaques and plaques with stenosis
> or = 90\% produced a higher number of embolic particles and therefore
may be less suitable for balloon angioplasty and stenting. This ex
vivo model can be used to identify high-risk lesions for balloon
angioplasty and stenting and can aid in the evaluation of new devices
being considered for carotid balloon angioplasty and stenting.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare black-blood multicontrast carotid imaging at 3T
and 1.5T and assess compatibility between morphological measurements
of carotid arteries at 1.5T and 3T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five healthy
subjects and two atherosclerosis patients were scanned in 1.5T and
3T scanners with a similar protocol providing transverse T1-, T2-,
and proton density (PD)-weighted black-blood images using a fast
spin-echo sequence with single- (T1-weighted) or multislice (PD-/T2-weighted)
double inversion recovery (DIR) preparation. Wall and lumen signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) and wall/lumen contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were compared
in 44 artery cross-sections by paired t-test. Interscanner variability
of the lumen area (LA), wall area (WA), and mean wall thickness (MWT)
was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: Wall SNR and lumen/wall
CNR significantly increased (P < 0.0001) at 3T with a 1.5-fold gain
for T1-weighted images and a 1.7/1.8-fold gain for PD-/T2-weighted
images. Lumen SNR did not differ for single-slice DIR T1-weighted
images (P = 0.2), but was larger at 3T for multislice DIR PD-/T2-weighted
images (P = 0.01/0.03). The LA, WA, and MWT demonstrated good agreement
with no significant bias (P 0.5), a coefficient of variation (CV)
of < 10\%, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of > 0.95.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated significant improvement in SNR,
CNR, and image quality for high- resolution black-blood imaging of
carotid arteries at 3T. Morphologic measurements are compatible between
1.5T and 3T.},

@article{Rothwell2000,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major thrombotic and embolic complications of atherosclerosis
are closely associated with irregularity and rupture of atheromatous
plaques in both the carotid and coronary arteries. Plaque instability
is partly determined by local factors, but systemic factors, such
as infection, autoimmunity, or genes, may also be important. If plaque
stability is influenced by systemic factors that are present in only
a proportion of patients, some individuals should be more prone to
rupture of plaques than others--ie, irregular plaques should occur
in multiple vascular beds in some individuals more frequently than
would be expected by chance alone. METHODS: We studied 5393 carotid
bifurcation angiograms from 3007 patients with a recently symptomatic
carotid stenosis. We assessed the extent to which plaque-surface
irregularity at the symptomatic carotid artery was associated with
irregularity at a distant site, the contralateral carotid artery,
and the extent to which plaque irregularity at these sites was associated
with previous myocardial infarction or subsequent non-stroke vascular
death (due mainly to coronary-artery disease). FINDINGS: Patients
with plaque-surface irregularity (n=1897) in the symptomatic carotid
artery were more likely than those with smooth plaque (n=110) to
have irregularity in the contralateral carotid artery (odds ratio
2.21 [95\% CI 1.62-3.01], p<0.001). Patients with irregular plaques
in both arteries were more likely to have had a previous myocardial
infarction than patients with smooth plaques (hazard ratio 1.82 [1.23-2.64],
p<0.001), and were more likely to have a non-stroke vascular death
on follow-up (hazard ratio 1.67 [1.15-2.44], p=0.007). However, there
was no difference in the risk of non-vascular death (hazard ratio
0.92 [0.57-1.45], p=0.5). These associations were not explicable
on the basis of differences in traditional vascular risk factors.
INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that some individuals have a systemic
predisposition to irregularity and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques
that is independent of traditional vascular risk factors. This finding
supports the hypothesis that other systemic factors are important
in the cause of plaque instability.},

of stroke. We investigated whether elevated hsCRP level is a risk
factor for the increased IMT of the CCA independent of other proven
risk factors for the ischemic stroke and studied the interaction
between hsCRP level and the extent of carotid atherosclerosis. METHODS
AND RESULTS: We studied 104 patients aged between 30 to 92 years
who were admitted to our neurology department with acute ischemic
stroke. All patients underwent a clinical evaluation, laboratory
investigations, and neuroultrasonographic examination. In 24 patients
with normal ultrasonographic examination, mean hsCRP levels was 8.6
+ 6.7 mg/L. Mean hsCRP level was 18.0 + 25.6 mg/L in patients having
increased intima to media thickness (> 1.2 mm); 32.7 + 49.1 mg/L
in patients who had atheromatous plaques without significant narrowing;
and 23.9 + 27.3 mg/L in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis
more than 50\%. hsCRP levels and the extent of the atherosclerosis
showed a significant relationship (p = 0.040). In multiple regression
analyses, this relationship was found to be independent of other
proven risk factors. The only variable that showed a significant
relation with the level of hsCRP was the HDL level. A negative correlation
was found between hsCRP and HDL levels. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude
that elevated hsCRP level is an indirect risk factor for the ischemic
stroke through its relation with the extent of the carotid atherosclerosis,
and this relation is independent of other known risk factors.},

associated with stroke and other cerebrovascular events. The purpose
of this study was to examine whether cholesterol-lowering therapy
with atorvastatin in nonhypercholesterolemic patients reduces carotid
plaque instability as assessed by ultrasound integrated backscatter
(IBS) analysis. METHODS: Consecutive non- or slightly hypercholesterolemic
patients with moderate carotid artery stenosis were randomly assigned
to a diet group (n = 20) or a statin group (atorvastatin; n = 20).
Carotid plaques were monitored by measuring intima media thickness
(IMT) and IBS values at baseline and after 6 months. RESULTS: Three-dimensional
IBS imaging showed that relative lipid volume of carotid plaques
significantly decreased from 58.4 +/- 25.6 to 47.8 +/- 23.5\% in
the statin group (p < 0.01), whereas there was no significant decrease
in the diet group. Significant regression of IMT was not observed
in either group. The changes of IBS values and relative lipid volume
between baseline and 6 months were correlated with the change in
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.31, p < 0.05, and r =
0.34, p < 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Lipid-lowering therapy
by atorvastatin decreased relative lipid volume without significant
regression of plaque volume during short-term follow-up in patients
with moderate carotid artery stenosis. Quantitative assessment of
carotid plaques by IBS analysis was clinically useful for monitoring

abstract = {Several factors affect the accuracy and precision of ultrasonic spectrum
analysis, which is used for characterization of normal and diseased
tissue in a variety of organs. For example, averaging procedures
and the sequence of operations affect the accuracy and precision

amplitudes and the values of intercept and midband fit; the bias
depends on the sequencing of the log conversion and averaging as

before dB conversion and before computing spectral parameters by
linear regression. Experimental results using phantoms agree remarkably
with theoretical predictions for the data window functions studied

@article{Loree1991,
abstract = {Turbulence frequently develops when blood passes through a stenosis.  To study the hypothesis that turbulence near a plaque surface can cause pressure fluctuations that may promote plaque rupture, models of intravascular stenoses were studied.  Experimental conditions simulated peak flow in the coronary and carotid arteries through a stenosis of 80 or 90\% diameter reduction and into a region where the plaque had widened distally to a 50-75\% stenosis.  For symmetric stenoses at carotid artery flow rates, peak pressure fluctuations were observed 1-1.5 upstream diameters distal to the stenosis, but there were no significant turbulent pressure fluctuations at coronary artery flow rates.  Stenosis asymmetry strongly increased the intensity of turbulent pressure fluctuations at flows simulating carotid flow and resulted in significant pressure fluctuations for coronary flow conditions.  Increasing stenosis severity from 80 to 90\% increased the root mean square pressure fluctuations 3.6-fold.  These studies predict peak to peak pressure fluctuations of 15 mmHg in a 90\% asymmetric coronary stenosis; it is possible that turbulence may play a role in acute damage of atherosclerotic plaques, particularly in asymmetric stenoses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been hypothesized that high structural
stress in atherosclerotic plaques at critical sites may contribute
to plaque disruption. To test that hypothesis, 3D fluid-structure
interaction models were constructed based on in vivo MRI data of
human atherosclerotic carotid plaques to assess structural stress
behaviors of plaques with and without rupture. METHODS: In vivo MRI
data of carotid plaques from 12 patients scheduled for endarterectomy
were acquired for model reconstruction. Histology confirmed that
5 of the 12 plaques had rupture. Plaque wall stress (PWS) and flow
maximum shear stress were extracted from all nodal points on the
lumen surface of each plaque for analysis. A critical PWS (maximum
of PWS values from all possible vulnerable sites) was determined
for each plaque. RESULTS: Mean PWS from all ulcer nodes in ruptured
plaques was 86\% higher than that from all nonulcer nodes (123.0
versus 66.3 kPa, P<0.0001). Mean flow maximum shear stress from all
ulcer nodes in ruptured plaques was 170\% higher than that from all
nonulcer nodes (38.9 versus 14.4 dyn/cm2, P<0.0001). Mean critical
PWS from the 5 ruptured plaques was 126\% higher than that from the
7 nonruptured ones (247.3 versus 108 kPa, P=0.0016 using log transformation).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that plaques with prior
ruptures are associated with higher critical stress conditions, both
at ulcer sites and when compared with nonruptured plaques. With further
validations, plaque stress analysis may provide additional stress
indicators helpful for image-based plaque vulnerability assessment.},

@article{Madsen1984,
abstract = {In previous methods of data reduction used to determine ultrasonic backscatter coefficients, various approximations were made. One frequently used is that there is an abrupt cutoff in the lateral extent of the scattering volume interrogated. Another approximation in all previous methods is that the effect of time gating the received echo signals can be written as a function of the distance along the axis of the interrogating beam. In the present paper we show that the backscatter coefficient can be derived from experimental data without making such approximations. The cases of narrow-band and broadband pulses are treated, and the method is applicable whatever the distance between the interrogated volume of scatterers and the transducer face. It is shown that, for a given pulse form, the gate duration must be sufficiently long in order to attain a specified accuracy for the measured backscatter coefficient. A test of the method was done using a phantom with well-defined scattering properties. Very good agreement was found between measured values of backscatter coefficients and those calculated using a first-principles theory.},

abstract = {Risk assessment in patients with carotid atherosclerosis relies on the degree of luminal stenosis. Incorporating morphological information on plaque composition obtained noninvasively through the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could include other variables besides the degree of stenosis into carotid plaque risk assessment. Knowledge of the morphologic composition of the plaque allows determination of mechanic stresses exerted on the protective fibrous cap, which may be of importance in the assessment of plaque vulnerability. Based on image processing of transverse MRI scans, longitudinal 2D fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations of carotid atherosclerotic plaques were performed facilitating in-vivo estimation of longitudinal internal fibrous cap stresses. The FSI simulation combined finite element analysis (FEA) with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of blood-flow variables. Preliminary results from two symptomatic patients revealed longitudinal stress levels (max. 254.1 and 143.2 kPa) approaching established criteria for plaque rupture at known predilection sites of plaque rupture. Determination of longitudinal fibrous cap stresses may prove useful in assessing plaque vulnerability and improve risk stratification in patients with carotid atherosclerosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine whether a stratified gray-scale
median (GSM) analysis of the carotid plaque combined with color mapping
could predict plaque histology better than an overall GSM measurement.
METHODS: Thirty-one carotid plaques derived from 28 patients undergoing
carotid endarterectomy were investigated by ultrasound. GSMs of the
whole plaque were used as measurement of echogenicity. A profile
of the regional GSM as a function of distance from the plaque surface
could be generated. Plaque pixels were further mapped into 3 different
colors depending on their GSM value. RESULTS: Plaques with large
calcifications presented the highest GSM values, and those with large
hemorrhagic areas or with a predominant necrotic core exhibited the
lowest. Fibrous plaques had intermediate GSM values. A necrotic core
located in a juxtalumenal position was associated with significantly
lower GSM values (P=0.009) and with a predominant red color (GSM
<50) at the surface (P=0.0019). With respect to the thickness of
the fibrous cap and the position of the necrotic core, the sensitivity
and specificity of the predominant red color of the whole plaque
was respectively 45\% and 67\% and 53\% and 75\%; considering the
predominant red color of the surface, the sensitivity and specificity
increased to 73\% and 67\% and 84\% and 75\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
The stratified GSM measurement combined with color mapping showed
a good correlation with the different histopathological components
and further allowed identification with good accuracy of determinants
of plaque instability. This approach should be investigated in a
prospective, natural history study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Real-time compound ultrasound imaging is a
new technique for improving the image quality of B-mode scanning.
We investigated the value of this method for the characterization
of atherosclerotic plaques in the internal carotid artery. METHODS:
Thirty-two patients (22 men, 10 women; mean age, 75 years) with plaques
of the internal carotid artery as identified by high-resolution B-mode
scanning were investigated with real-time compound ultrasound imaging
with the use of a 5- to 12-MHz dynamic range linear transducer on
a duplex scanner. Two independent observers rated plaque morphology
according to a standardized protocol. RESULTS: The majority of plaques
was classified as predominantly echogenic and as plaques of irregular
surface, whereas ulcerated plaques were rarely observed. The interobserver
agreement for plaque surface characterization was good for both compound
ultrasound (kappa=0.72) and conventional B-mode (kappa=0.65). For
the determination of plaque echogenicity, the reproducibility of
compound ultrasound (kappa(w)=0.83) was even higher than that of
conventional B-mode ultrasound (kappa(w)=0.74). According to a semiquantitative
analysis, real-time compound ultrasound was rated superior in the
categories plaque texture resolution, plaque surface definition,
and vessel wall demarcation. Furthermore, there was a significant
reduction of acoustic shadowing and reverberations. CONCLUSIONS:
Real-time compound ultrasound is a suitable technique for the characterization
of atherosclerotic plaques, showing good general agreement with high-resolution
B-mode imaging. This advanced technique allows reduction of ultrasound
artifacts and improves the assessment of plaque texture and surface
for enhanced evaluation of carotid plaque morphology.},

integrated backscatter (IB) combined with conventional intravascular
ultrasound (IVUS) makes tissue characterization of coronary arterial
plaques possible. METHODS AND RESULTS: IB-IVUS was performed in coronary
arteries (total 18 segments) of 9 patients at autopsy, and the findings
were compared with the histology. RF signals, which were digitized
at 2 GHz in 8-bit resolution, were obtained with an IVUS system with
a 40-MHz catheter. IB values of the RF signal from the region of
interest (ROI) (100-microm depth, 1.4 degrees per line) were calculated
by use of a personal computer. IB values on the ROIs were divided
into 5 categories, compared with each of the plaque histologies:
category 1 (thrombus), -88 < IB < or = -80; category 2 (intimal hyperplasia
or lipid core), -73 < IB < or = -63; category 3 (fibrous tissue),
-63 < IB < or = -55; category 4 (mixed lesions), -55 < IB < or =
-30; and category 5 (calcification), -30 < IB < or = -23. On the
basis of these categories, we analyzed 5120 ROIs per segment in each
ring-like arterial specimen. Color-coded maps of plaques were constructed
by use of these IB data and conventional IVUS data, which reflected
the plaque histology of autopsied coronary arteries well. Then, the
same method was undertaken in 24 segments with plaque from 12 patients
in vivo with angina pectoris. Comparisons between coronary angioscopy

reflected the thickness of the fibrous cap rather than the size of
the lipid core. CONCLUSIONS: IB-IVUS represents a new and useful
tool for evaluating the tissue structure of human coronary arterial
plaques.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: More than half of all cerebral ischemic events are the
result of rupture of extracranial plaques. The clinical determination
of carotid plaque vulnerability is currently based solely on luminal
stenosis; however, it has been increasingly suggested that plaque
morphology and biomechanical stress should also be considered. We
used finite element analysis based on in vivo magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) to simulate the stress distributions within plaques
of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. METHODS: Thirty non-consecutive
subjects (15 symptomatic and 15 asymptomatic) underwent high-resolution
multisequence in vivo MRI of the carotid bifurcation. Stress analysis
was performed based on the geometry derived from in vivo MRI of the
carotid artery at the point of maximal stenosis. The finite element
analysis model considered plaque components to be hyperelastic. The
peak stresses within the plaques of symptomatic and asymptomatic
individuals were compared. RESULTS: High stress concentrations were
found at the shoulder regions of symptomatic plaques, and the maximal
stresses predicted in this group were significantly higher than those
in the asymptomatic group (508.2 +/- 193.1 vs 269.6 +/- 107.9 kPa;
P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Maximal predicted plaque stresses in symptomatic
patients were higher than those predicted in asymptomatic patients
by finite element analysis, suggesting the possibility that plaques
with higher stresses may be more prone to be symptomatic and rupture.
If further validated by large-scale longitudinal studies, biomechanical
stress analysis based on high resolution in vivo MRI could potentially
act as a useful tool for risk assessment of carotid atheroma. It
may help in the identification of patients with asymptomatic carotid
atheroma at greatest risk of developing symptoms or mild-to-moderate
symptomatic stenoses, which currently fall outside current clinical
guidelines for intervention.},

abstract = {Many studies have demonstrated that time-domain speed-of-sound (SOS) measurements in calcaneus are predictive of osteoporotic fracture risk. However, there is a lack of standardization fur this measurement. Consequently, different investigators using different measurement systems and analysis algorithms obtain disparate quantitative values for calcaneal SOS, impairing and often precluding meaningful comparison and/or pooling of measurements. A numerical method has been developed to model the effects of frequency-dependent attenuation and dispersion on transit-time-based SOS estimates. The numerical technique is based on a previously developed linear system analytic model for Gaussian pulses propagating through linearly attenuating, weakly dispersive media. The numerical approach is somewhat more general in that it can be used to predict the effects of arbitrary pulse shapes and dispersion relationships. The numerical technique, however, utilizes several additional assumptions (compared with the analytic model) which would be required for the practical task of correcting existing clinical databases. These include a single dispersion relationship for all calcaneus samples, a simple linear model relating phase velocity to broadband ultrasonic attenuation, and a constant calcaneal thickness. Measurements on a polycarbonate plate and 30 human calcaneus samples were in good quantitative agreement with numerical predictions. In addition, the numerical approach predicts that in cancellous bone, frequency-dependent attenuation tends to be a greater contributor to variations ire transit-time-based SOS estimates than dispersion. This approach may be used to adjust previously acquired individual measurements so that SOS data recorded with different devices using different algorithms may be compared in a meaningful fashion.},

abstract = {An analytic model is described for application in ultrasonic tissue
characterization. The model is applicable to clinical broadband pulse
echo systems. It treats spectra derived from received echo signals
and relates them to physical tissue properties. The model can be
applied to deterministic tissue structures (e.g., retinal detachments,
larger blood vessels, and surface layers of the kidney) and to stochastic
tissue structures (e.g., various tumors). The beam patterns included
in the model are those generated by focused transducers typically
used in high-resolution clinical ultrasound. Appropriate calibration
procedures are also treated; these are needed for interpretation
of absolute spectral parameters. The results obtained with the analytic
model have been used to design a digital processing system and the
associated techniques which are now being applied during examinations
of the eye and abdominal organs. The results have proven useful in
interpreting data from various types of tissues. To illustrate the
application of these results, representative clinical data, obtained
from the digital system, are presented for two types of tissue architectures.
The first case is a detached retina representing a deterministic
structure characterized by well-defined thickness and reflection
coefficients. The second case is asteroid hyalosis and represents
a stochastic entity in which the positions of small scattering particles
are best described in statistical terms, and characterization is
accompanied by means of normalized power spectra.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Individuals with carotid atherosclerosis develop symptoms
following rupture of vulnerable plaques. Biomechanical stresses within
this plaque may increase vulnerability to rupture. In this report
the authors describe the use of in vivo carotid plaque imaging and
computational mechanics to document the magnitude and distribution
of intrinsic plaque stresses. METHODS: Ten (five symptomatic and
five asymptomatic) individuals underwent plaque characterization
magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Plaque geometry and composition
were determined by multisequence review. Intrinsic plaque stress
profiles were generated from 3D meshes by using finite element computational
analysis. Differences in principal (shear) stress between normal
and diseased sections of the carotid artery and between symptomatic
and asymptomatic plaques were noted. RESULTS: There was a significant
difference in peak principal stress between diseased and nondiseased
segments of the artery (mean difference 537.65 kPa, p < 0.05). Symptomatic
plaques had higher mean stresses than asymptomatic plaques (627.6
kPa compared with 370.2 kPa, p = 0.05), which were independent of
luminal stenosis and plaque composition. CONCLUSION: Significant
differences in plaque stress exist between plaques from symptomatic
individuals and those from asymptomatic individuals. The MR imaging-based
computational analysis may therefore be a useful aid to identification
of vulnerable plaques in vivo.},

abstract = {Coronary artery disease is the number one cause of death in the United
States and the Western world, and approximately 250,000 affected
people die per year without ever being admitted to a hospital. One
of the main reasons of such a high death-rate without any diagnosis
is that more than 50 or heart-attacks) occur in patients with no
prior history of known heart disease or symptoms. Coronary artery
disease leads to the occlusion of arteries that are vital in providing
nutrients to the heart muscles. The disease develops by progressive
accumulation or formation of "plaque" within an artery. Certain types
of plaques could occlude blood flow and yet might be "stable". These
plaques usually have a high fibrous content, and are known as hard
plaques. On the other hand, "unstable" or "soft" plaques might not
cause much occlusion but could be vulnerable to rupture. Rupture
of such plaques could lead to total or partial occlusion in arteries
resulting in sudden cardiac death or heart-attack. In fact, 68 coronary
arteries are less than 50.Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a minimally
invasive imaging modality that provides cross-section images of arteries
in real-time, allowing visualization of atherosclerotic plaques in
vivo. In standard IVUS gray-scale images, calcified regions of plaque
and dense fibrous components generally reflect ultrasound energy
well and thus appear bright and homogeneous on IVUS images. Conversely,
regions of low echo reflectance in IVUS images are usually labeled
"soft" or "mixed" plaque. However, this visual interpretation has
been demonstrated to be very inconsistent in accurately determining
plaque composition and does not allow real-time assessment of quantitative
plaque constituents.Spectral analysis of the backscattered radiofrequency
(RF) ultrasound signals allows detailed assessment of plaque composition.
Advanced mathematical techniques can be employed to extract spectral
information from these RF data to determine composition. The spectral
content or signature of RF data reflected from tissue depends on
density, compressibility, concentration, size, etc. A combination
of spectral parameters were used to develop statistical classification
schemes for analysis of in vivo IVUS data in real-time. The clinical
data acquisition system is ECG gated and the analysis software developed
by our group reconstructs IVUS gray-scale images from the acquired
RF data. A combination of spectral parameters and active contour
models is used for real-time 3D plaque segmentation followed by computation
of color-coded tissue maps for each image cross-section and longitudinal
views of the entire vessel. The "fly-through" mode allows one to
visualize the complete length of the artery internally with the histology
components at the lumen surface. In addition, vessel and plaque metrics
such as areas and volumes of individual plaque components (collagen,
fibro-lipid, calcium, lipid-core) are also available.},

In vitro experiments on human coronary and femoral arteries have demonstrated that different plaque types were detectable with intravascular ultrasound elastography. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of applying intravascular elastography during interventional catheterization procedures. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were acquired in patients (n=12) during PTCA procedures with an EndoSonics InVision echoapparatus equipped with radiofrequency output. The systemic pressure was used to strain the tissue, and the strain was determined using cross-correlation analysis of sequential frames. A likelihood function was determined to obtain the frames with minimal motion of the catheter in the lumen, since motion of the catheter prevents reliable strain estimation. Minimal motion was observed near end-diastole. Reproducible strain estimates were obtained within one pressure cycle and over several pressure cycles. Validation of the results was limited to the information provided by the echogram. Strain in calcified material (0.20\%+/-0.07) was lower (P<0.001) than in non-calcified tissue (0.51\%+/-0.20). CONCLUSION: In vivo intravascular elastography is feasible. Significantly higher strain values were found in non-calcified plaques than in calcified plaques.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that carotid endarterectomy
in patients with symptomatic severe carotid stenosis (defined as
stenosis of 70 to 99 percent of the luminal diameter) is beneficial
up to two years after the procedure. In this clinical trial, we assessed
the benefit of carotid endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic
moderate stenosis, defined as stenosis of less than 70 percent. We
also studied the durability of the benefit of endarterectomy in patients
with severe stenosis over eight years of follow-up. METHODS: Patients
who had moderate carotid stenosis and transient ischemic attacks
or nondisabling strokes on the same side as the stenosis (ipsilateral)
within 180 days before study entry were stratified according to the
degree of stenosis (50 to 69 percent or <50 percent) and randomly
assigned either to undergo carotid endarterectomy (1108 patients)
or to receive medical care alone (1118 patients). The average follow-up
was five years, and complete data on outcome events were available
for 99.7 percent of the patients. The primary outcome event was any
fatal or nonfatal stroke ipsilateral to the stenosis for which the
patient underwent randomization. RESULTS: Among patients with stenosis
of 50 to 69 percent, the five-year rate of any ipsilateral stroke
(failure rate) was 15.7 percent among patients treated surgically
and 22.2 percent among those treated medically (P=0.045); to prevent
one ipsilateral stroke during the five-year period, 15 patients would
have to be treated with carotid endarterectomy. Among patients with
less than 50 percent stenosis, the failure rate was not significantly
lower in the group treated with endarterectomy (14.9 percent) than
in the medically treated group (18.7 percent, P=0.16). Among the
patients with severe stenosis who underwent endarterectomy, the 30-day
rate of death or disabling ipsilateral stroke persisting at 90 days
was 2.1 percent; this rate increased to only 6.7 percent at 8 years.
Benefit was greatest among men, patients with recent stroke as the
qualifying event, and patients with hemispheric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS:
Endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic moderate carotid stenosis
of 50 to 69 percent yielded only a moderate reduction in the risk
of stroke. Decisions about treatment for patients in this category
must take into account recognized risk factors, and exceptional surgical
skill is obligatory if carotid endarterectomy is to be performed.
Patients with stenosis of less than 50 percent did not benefit from
surgery. Patients with severe stenosis (> or =70 percent) had a durable
benefit from endarterectomy at eight years of follow-up.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND. Although rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque is considered
to be the cause of most acute coronary syndromes, the mechanism of
plaque rupture is controversial. METHODS AND RESULTS. To test the
hypothesis that plaque rupture occurs at sites of high circumferential
stress in the diseased vessel, the distribution of stress was analyzed
in 24 coronary artery lesions. Histological specimens from 12 coronary
artery lesions that caused lethal myocardial infarction were compared
with those from 12 stable control lesions. A finite element model
was used to calculate the stress distributions at a mean intraluminal
pressure of 110 mm Hg. The maximum circumferential stress in plaques
that ruptured was significantly higher than maximum stress in stable
specimens (4,091 +/- 1,199 versus 1,444 +/- 485 mm Hg, p < 0.0001).
Twelve of 12 ruptured lesions had a total of 31 regions of stress
concentration of more than 2,250 mm Hg (mean, 2.6 +/- 1.4 high stress
regions per lesion); only one of 12 control lesions had a single
stress concentration region of more than 2,250 mm Hg. In seven of
12 lethal lesions (58\%), rupture occurred in the region of maximum
circumferential stress; in 10 of the 12 lethal lesions (83\%), rupture
occurred in a region where computed stress was more than 2,250 mm
Hg. CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest that concentrations of circumferential
tensile stress in the atherosclerotic plaque may play an important
role in plaque rupture and myocardial infarction. However, plaque
rupture may not always occur at the region of highest stress, suggesting
that local variations in plaque material properties contribute to
plaque rupture.},

precedes the onset of clinical syndromes, and studies have implicated
a role for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in this process. The
aim of this study was to establish the character, level, and expression
of MMPs in carotid plaques and to correlate this with clinical status,
cerebral embolization, and histology. METHODS: Plaques were obtained
from 75 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and
divided into 4 groups according to symptomatology (group 1, asymptomatic;
group 2, symptomatic >6 months before surgery; group 3, symptomatic
within 1 to 6 months; group 4, symptomatic within 1 month). All patients
underwent preoperative and intraoperative transcranial Doppler monitoring.
Plaques were subjected to histological examination and quantification
of MMPs by zymography and ELISA. RESULTS: The level of MMP-9 was
significantly higher in group 4 (median 125.7 ng/mL for group 4,
median <32 ng/mL for all other groups; P=0.003), with no difference
in the levels of MMPs 1, 2, or 3. Furthermore, the MMP-9 concentration
was significantly higher in plaques undergoing spontaneous embolization
(P=0.019) and those with histological evidence of plaque instability
(P<0.03). In situ hybridization demonstrated increased MMP-9 expression
in highly symptomatic plaques in areas of intense inflammatory infiltrate.
CONCLUSIONS: The concentration, production, and expression of MMP-9
is significantly higher in unstable carotid plaques. If this proves
to be a causal relationship, MMP-9 may be a strong candidate for
pharmacotherapy aimed at stabilizing plaques and preventing stroke.},

In both the small and large deformation scenarios, the algorithms performed well, clearly identifying the two mechanically disparate regions of the phantom. The stiffness ratio between the two regions was estimated to be the same for the two scenarios and both estimates agreed with the expected stiffness ratio based on earlier mechanical testing.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is scant population-based evidence regarding
extracranial carotid plaque surface irregularity and ischemic stroke.
Using a prospective cohort design, we evaluated the association of
carotid plaque surface irregularity and the risk of ischemic stroke
in a multiethnic population. METHODS: High-resolution B-mode ultrasound
of the carotid arteries was performed in 1939 stroke-free subjects
(mean age 69+/-10.0 years; 59\% women; 53\% Hispanic, 25\% black,
22\% white). Plaque was defined as a focal protrusion 50\% greater
than the surrounding area and localized along the extracranial carotid
tree (internal carotid artery/bifurcation vs common carotid artery).
Plaque surface was categorized as regular or irregular. Cox proportional
hazard models were used to assess the association of surface characteristics
and the risk of ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Among 1939 total subjects,
carotid plaque was visualized in 56.3\% (1 plaque: 21.6\%, >1 plaque:
34.7\%, irregular plaque: 5.5\%). During a mean follow up of 6.2
years after ultrasound examination, 69 ischemic strokes occurred.
Unadjusted cumulative 5-year risks of ischemic stroke were: 1.3\%,
3.0\%, and 8.5\% for no plaque, regular plaque, and irregular plaque,
respectively. After adjusting for demographics, traditional vascular
risk factors, degree of stenosis, and plaque thickness, presence
of irregular plaque (vs no plaque) was independently associated with
ischemic stroke (Hazard ratio, 3.1; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 8.5). CONCLUSIONS:
The presence of irregular carotid plaque independently predicted
ischemic stroke in a multiethnic cohort. Plaque surface irregularities
assessed by B-mode ultrasonography may help identify intermediate-
to high-risk individuals beyond their vascular risk assessed by the
presence of traditional risk factors.},

found infrequently, was closely correlated with the presence of symptoms.
Plaque ulcerations were encountered more often when lesions were
symptomatic. Calcifications were more frequently associated with
asymptomatic lesions. Consistency of plaque was related to its morphological
features (stenosis or ulceration) and symptoms. Soft plaques with
predominant atheromatous grumous material and hemorrhage were associated
more often with tightly stenotic, ulcerated, and symptomatic lesions.
Consistency of atherosclerotic carotid plaques should be assessed
and considered as an important element in the therapeutic decision.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mixed pathologies are common in older persons with dementia.
Little is known about mixed pathologies in probable Alzheimer disease
(AD) and about the spectrum of neuropathology in mild cognitive impairment
(MCI). The objective of this study was to investigate single and
mixed common age-related neuropathologies in persons with probable
AD and MCI. METHODS: The study included 483 autopsied participants
from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project
with probable AD (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative
Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association
criteria), MCI (amnestic and nonamnestic), or no cognitive impairment.
We excluded 41 persons with clinically possible AD and 14 with other
dementias. We documented the neuropathology of AD (National Institute
on Aging-Reagan criteria), macroscopic cerebral infarcts, and neocortical
Lewy body (LB) disease. RESULTS: Of 179 persons (average age, 86.9
years) with probable AD, 87.7\% had pathologically confirmed AD,
and 45.8\% had mixed pathologies, most commonly AD with macroscopic
infarcts (n = 54), followed by AD with neocortical LB disease (n
= 19) and both (n = 8). Of the 134 persons with MCI, 54.4\% had pathologically
diagnosed AD (58.7\% amnestic; 49.2\% nonamnestic); 19.4\% had mixed
pathologies (22.7\% amnestic; 15.3\% nonamnestic). Macroscopic infarcts
without pathologically diagnosed AD accounted for 4.5\% of probable
AD, 13.3\% of amnestic MCI, and 18.6\% of nonamnestic MCI. Pure neocortical
LB disease was uncommon in all persons with cognitive impairment
(<6\%). Microscopic infarcts (without macroscopic infarcts) were
common as a mixed pathology, but rarely accounted for a clinical
diagnosis of probable AD (n = 4) or MCI (n = 3). INTERPRETATION:
Clinically diagnosed probable AD and MCI, even amnestic MCI, are
pathologically heterogeneous disorders, with many persons exhibiting
mixed pathologies.},

abstract = {Endothelial activation and infiltration of monocyte macrophages are essential prerequisites for fibrous cap formation, which comprises proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells and net matrix deposition. Macrophage foam cells and endothelium act as a source of growth factors and chemoattractants for smooth muscle cells. However, growth factors alone do not stimulate smooth muscle cell proliferation or migration. This requires, in addition, the remodelling of the extracellular matrix, at least partly mediated by metalloproteinases. In particular, loss of basement membrane components and contact with the interstitial matrix appears to be required to release a brake on proliferation and migration exerted by the basement membrane. Unless there is a change in the phenotype of macrophages in advanced lesions, it is not clear why fibrous cap destruction rather than formation should take place in macrophage-rich shoulder regions of plaques. Impaired cap formation caused by smooth muscle senescence, mummification and propensity to apoptosis may be as important as increased cap destruction in promoting plaque rupture.},

abstract = {The aim of this review is to summarize present knowledge of the ultrasonic
detection and determinants of carotid atherosclerosis with lipid-rich
cores and to review the evidence that these measures of plaque type
may predict cerebral events. With the use of high-resolution ultrasound
B-mode imaging, carotid plaques evaluated as only weakly reflecting
the ultrasound beam (echolucent) have been associated with a higher
risk of neurological events than are plaques reflecting the ultrasound
signal strongly (echorich). Histologically, these echolucent plaques
have a higher content of lipid and hemorrhage than do echorich plaques,
which contain more calcification and fibrous tissue. Findings in
the coronary arteries indicate that a lipid-rich plaque with a thin,
fibrous cap is more vulnerable, is more prone to rupture, and cause
symptoms compared with fibrous plaques. A search for determinants
in the blood for these vulnerable plaques suggests that low density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is the best lipid predictor for the
extent of atherosclerosis, whereas triglyceride-rich lipoproteins
in particular seem to predict an echolucent plaque. Lowering of LDL
cholesterol and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in plasma is associated
with reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis and coronary
events. LDL cholesterol reduction is also associated with a reduced
stroke rate. These improvements in the prognosis are thought to be
the result of a reduction in the lipid content of the plaques, making
them more stable and resistant to rupture rather than an actual reduction
in plaque volume and degree of stenosis. In conclusion, it appears
that ultrasound B-mode imaging as well as lipoproteins presumably
may predict dangerous and rupture-prone, lipid-rich plaques in the
carotid arteries, thereby being potential diagnostic tools in the
prevention of neurological events.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the accuracy of the main Doppler methods for
quantifying the degree of carotid stenoses in 133 patients. METHOD:
seven parameters were measured: maximum velocity (V.max) inside the
stenosis (by pulsed wave [PW]), grade and index of spectral disturbance
(STI) at the outlet of the stenosis (by PW and continuous wave [CW]),
ratio of velocities I(IC/CC) in the internal and common carotid (by
PW), and ratio of vessel cross-section and residual lumen area (\%Color)
inside the stenosis (color Doppler). The reference methods were the
grades of spectral disturbance and the STI (by CW), already validated
against endarterectomy specimens. CONCLUSION: For poststenosis measurements,
a high correlation was found between the grades or STI measured by
PW and CW (reference method). The measurement of these parameters
was easier in PW mode. For intrastenotic velocity, the increase in
V.max was not proportional to the degree of stenosis, and V.max showed
large fluctuations for the same degree of stenosis. I(IC/CC) also
showed large fluctuations for the same degree of stenosis. The correlation
was poor for these two parameters, which could only be used for detecting
two groups of stenosis: >75\% or >90\% in area. Color Doppler (conventional
and power) routinely overestimated the degree of stenosis by 10\%-15\%
but correlated better with the reference method and was more accurate
and reproducible than V.max. A special procedure can be used to avoid
this overestimation and improve the accuracy of the color Doppler.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES This study examined whether intensive cholesterol-lowering
therapy with statins in nonhypercholesterolemic patients is effective
in improving echolucency of vulnerable plaques assessed by ultrasound
with integrated backscatter (IBS) analysis. BACKGROUND Atherosclerotic
plaque stabilization is a promising clinical strategy to prevent
cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).
There is a correlation between coronary and carotid plaque instability,
and echolucent plaques are recognized as vulnerable plaques. METHODS
Consecutive nonhypercholesterolemic patients with CAD were randomly
assigned Adult Treatment Panel-III diet therapy (diet group; n =
30) or pravastatin (statin group; n = 30). Echolucent carotid plaques
were monitored by measuring intima-media thickness (IMT) and echogenicity
by IBS for six months. RESULTS Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were
significantly decreased in the statin group (from 197 +/- 15 mg/dl
to 170 +/- 18 mg/dl [p < 0.001]; from 131 +/- 14 mg/dl to 99 +/-
14 mg/dl [p < 0.001]; and from 0.11 [0.04 to 0.22] mg/dl to 0.06
[0.04 to 0.11] mg/dl [p < 0.05]; respectively), whereas only total
cholesterol was moderately reduced (from 193 +/- 24 mg/dl to 185
+/- 22 mg/dl [p < 0.05]) and LDL-C and triglycerides insignificantly
reduced in the diet group. Significant increases of echogenicity
of carotid plaques were noted in the statin group but not in the
diet group (from -18.5 +/- 4.1 dB to -15.9 +/- 3.7 dB [p < 0.001]
and from -18.2 +/- 4.0 dB to -18.9 +/- 3.5 dB [p = 0.13]; respectively)
without significant regression of plaque-IMT values in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS Statin therapy is rapidly effective in increasing echogenicity
of vulnerable plaques without regression of plaque size in nonhypercholesterolemic
patients with CAD. Quantitative assessment of carotid plaque quality
by ultrasound with IBS is clinically useful for monitoring atherosclerotic
lesions by evaluating vulnerability of atheroma.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arterial thrombosis plays a critical role in acute coronary
syndromes and stroke. Therefore, the ability to detect thrombus in
vivo has a significant clinical implication. Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) has shown promise in noninvasive thrombus detection. However,
thrombus characterization and age definition remain difficult. We
sought to evaluate the use of a fibrin-targeted peptide (EP-2104R)
for MR thrombus detection and to compare this modality with non-contrast-enhanced
(NCE) MRI and with Gd-DTPA injection at various ages and time points
after thrombus generation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Carotid artery thrombosis
was induced by external injury and stasis in 18 rabbits. T1-weighted
MRI was performed before and after contrast agent injection, within
6 hours of thrombus induction, at 48 hours, at 1 week, and every
week up to 8 weeks after injury. Correlation with histopathology
was performed. The fibrin-targeted contrast agent accurately detected
all thrombi, regardless of their size, location, and age. Although
thrombus signal intensity after injection decreased with thrombus
age (P<0.001), enhancement at 8 weeks was still present. Gd-DTPA
injection was not associated with an improvement of thrombus detection.
EP-2104R was superior to both NCE and Gd-DTPA injection (P<0.001).
Histopathologic examination showed thrombus organization over time.
Fibrin was gradually replaced by fibrous tissue. A strong correlation
was found between thrombus enhancement and collagen content of the
organizing thrombus with time (R=-0.89; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In
an experimental animal model of carotid thrombosis, we have demonstrated
the superiority of a fibrin-targeted MR contrast agent for in vivo
detection of chronic or organized thrombus, compared with NCE MRI
and Gd-DTPA injection.},

abstract = {Intravascular photoacoustic (IVPA) imaging is based on the detection of laser-induced acoustic waves generated within the arterial tissue under pulsed laser irradiation. In general, laser radiant energy levels are kept low (20 mJ/cm(2)) during photoacoustic imaging to conform to general standards for safe use of lasers on biological tissues. However, safety standards in intravascular photoacoustic imaging are not yet fully established. Consequently, monitoring spatio-temporal temperature changes associated with laser-tissue interaction is important to address thermal safety of IVPA imaging. In this study we utilize the IVUS-based strain measurements to estimate the laser-induced temperature increase. Temporal changes in temperature were estimated in a phantom modeling a vessel with an inclusion. A cross-correlation-based time delay estimator was used to assess temperature-induced strains produced by different laser radiant energies. The IVUS-based remote measurements revealed temperature increases of 0.7+/-0.3 degrees C, 2.9+/-0.2 degrees C and 5.0+/-0.2 degrees C, for the laser radiant energies of 30 mJ/cm(2), 60 mJ/cm(2) and 85 mJ/cm(2), respectively. The technique was then used in imaging of ex vivo samples of a normal rabbit aorta. For arterial tissues, a temperature elevation of 1.1 degrees C was observed for a laser fluence of 60 mJ/cm(2) and lesser than 1 degrees C for lower energy levels normally associated with IVPA imaging. Therefore, the developed ultrasound technique can be used to monitor temperature during IVPA imaging. Furthermore, the analysis based on the Arrhenius thermal damage model indicates no thermal injury in the arterial tissue, suggesting the safety of IVPA imaging.},

correlate positively with low and oscillating flow wall shear stresses

continue to grow under elevated FSS conditions. In vivo magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI)-based 2D/3D multi-component models with fluid-structure
interactions (FSI, 3D only) for human carotid atherosclerotic plaques
were introduced to quantify correlations between plaque progression
measured by wall thickness increase (WTI) and plaque wall (structure)
stress (PWS) conditions. A histologically validated multi-contrast
MRI protocol was used to acquire multi-year in vivo MRI images. Our
results using 2D models (200-700 data points/patient) indicated that
18 out of 21 patients studied showed significant negative correlation
between WTI and PWS at time 2 (T2). The 95\% confidence interval
for the Pearson correlation coefficient is (-0.443,-0.246), p<0.0001.
Our 3D FSI model supported the 2D correlation results and further
indicated that combining both plaque structure stress and flow shear
stress gave better approximation results (PWS, T2: R(2)=0.279; FSS,
T1: R(2)=0.276; combining both: R(2)=0.637). These pilot studies
suggest that both lower PWS and lower FSS may contribute to continued
plaque progression and should be taken into consideration in future
investigations of diseases related to atherosclerosis.},

abstract = {Spectral analysis of backscattered intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)
data has demonstrated the ability to characterize plaque. We compared
the ability of spectral parameters (e.g., slope, midband fit and
y-intercept), computed via classic Fourier transform (CPSD), Welch
power spectrum (WPSD) and autoregressive (MPSD) models, to classify
plaque composition. Data were collected ex vivo from 32 human left
anterior descending coronary arteries. Regions-of-interest (ROIs),
selected from histology, comprised 64 collagen-rich, 24 fibrolipidic,
23 calcified and 37 calcified-necrotic regions. A novel quantitative
method was used to correlate IVUS data with corresponding histologic
sections. Periodograms of IVUS samples, identified for each ROI,
were used to calculate spectral parameters. Statistical classification
trees (CT) were computed with 75\% of the data for plaque characterization.
The remaining data were used to assess the accuracy of the CTs. The
overall accuracies for normalized spectra with CPSD, WPSD and MPSD
were, respectively, 84.7\%, 85.6\% and 81.1\% (training data) and
54.1\%, 64.9\% and 37.8\% (test data). These numbers were improved
to 89.2\%, 91.9\% and 89.2\% (training) and 62.2\%, 73\% and 59.5\%
(test) when the calcified and calcified-necrotic regions were combined
for analysis. Most CTs misclassified a few fibrolipidic regions as
collagen, which is histologically acceptable, and the unnormalized
and normalized spectra results were similar.},

abstract = {The important influence of hemodynamic factors in the initiation and progression of arterial disease has led to numerous studies to computationally simulate blood flow at sites of disease and examine potential correlative factors. This study considers the differences in hemodynamics produced by varying heart rate in a fully coupled fluid-structure three-dimensional finite element model of a carotid bifurcation. Two cases with a 50\% increase in heart rate are considered: one in which peripheral resistance is uniformly reduced to maintain constant mean arterial pressure, resulting in an increase in mean flow, and a second in which cerebral vascular resistance is held constant so that mean carotid artery flow is nearly unchanged. Results show that, with increased flow rate, the flow patterns are relatively unchanged, but the magnitudes of mean and instantaneous wall shear stress are increased roughly in proportion to the flow rate, except at the time of minimum flow (and maximum flow separation) when shear stress in the carotid bulb is increased in magnitude more than threefold. When cerebral peripheral resistance is held constant, the differences are much smaller, except again at end diastole. Maximum wall shear stress temporal gradient is elevated in both cases with elevated heart rate. Changes in oscillatory shear index are minimal. These findings suggest that changes in the local hemodynamics due to mild exercise may be relatively small in the carotid artery.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study aims to define tissue characteristics of vulnerable
plaques before acute coronary syndrome (ACS) by use of integrated
backscatter intravascular ultrasound (IB-IVUS). BACKGROUND: Tissue
characterization of coronary plaques is possible with the use of
IB-IVUS. METHODS: The subjects were 140 patients with angina pectoris,
and we selected 160 coronary lesions without significant stenosis
for evaluation. Ultrasound signals were obtained by an IVUS system
using a 40-MHz catheter. RESULTS: At the follow-up (30 +/- 7 months),
12 plaques caused ACS after the initial IVUS examination. Ten of
the 12 plaques had IVUS parameters recorded at baseline. These 10
plaques were classified as vulnerable plaques (VP), and the other
plaques were classified as stable plaques (SP; n = 143). There was
no significant difference of vessel area, lumen area, and plaque
area between VP and SP. However, plaque burden (60 +/- 9\% vs. 52
+/- 9\%; p = 0.014), eccentricity (0.70 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.55 +/- 0.17;
p = 0.013), remodeling index (1.30 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.16; p
= 0.006) and percentage lipid area (72 +/- 10\% vs. 50 +/- 16\%;
p < 0.0001) were greater in VP than in SP. Percentage fibrous area
(23 +/- 6\% vs. 47 +/- 14\%; p < 0.0001) was smaller in VP than in
SP. The sensitivities, specificities, and positive predictive values
of percentage fibrous area (90\%, 96\%, and 69\%, respectively) and
percentage lipid area (80\%, 90\%, and 42\%, respectively) for classifying
VP were evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue characteristics of VP before
ACS were different from those of SP. This suggests that VP and SP
as classified by IB-IVUS are useful in predicting ACS.},

the coronary artery tree. Using quantitative coronary measurements,
the degree of coronary obstruction can be determined. The limitation
of coronary angiography is that it does not provide information on
the arterial wall structure and therefore cannot assess the extent
of atherosclerosis. Knowledge about adaptive coronary remodelling
processes as compensatory enlargement of the coronary artery has
focused diagnostic interest on the non-stenotic lesions of the coronary
tree. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) can reveal discrepancies between
the extent of coronary atherosclerosis and angiography imaging by
in vivo plaque imaging. Spectrum analysis of IVUS-derived radiofrequency
(RF) data enables a more detailed analysis of plaque composition
and morphology. Preliminary in vitro studies correlated four histological
plaque components with a specific spectrum analysis of the RF data.
The different components (fibrous, fibrofatty, necrotic core and
dense calcium) are colour coded. Coronary tissue maps were reconstructed
from RF data using IVUS-Virtual Histology (VH IVUS) software (Real-Time
VH, Volcano Corporation, Rancho Cordova, California, USA). VH IVUS
has the potential to detect high-risk lesions and can provide new
insights into the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease. VH
IVUS allows the differentiation of different lesion types based on

Slope and intercept parameters alone provided correct classification

that ultrasound plaque components may not consist solely of small,

abstract = {Intraplaque hemorrhage, enlarging lipid cores, and their proximity
to the flow lumen are important determinants of carotid plaque rupture
and neurological complications. We developed an image-analysis method
for B-mode ultrasound, pixel distribution analysis (PDA), for preprocedural
identification of these high-risk features in carotid plaques. This
technique may improve selection of patients for carotid endarterectomy
and carotid artery stenting. Forty-two patients with high-grade carotid
stenosis in 45 arteries, 18 symptomatic and 27 asymptomatic, underwent
preoperative ultrasound. Intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid, fibromuscular
tissue, calcium, lipid core area, and distance from the flow lumen
were quantified using pixel intensities of tissues in control subjects.
These findings were contrasted between symptomatic and asymptomatic
plaques and correlated with histology. Inter- and intraobserver variabilities
were determined for this technique. Pixel intensities of control
tissues were discrete and significantly different from each other
(median: blood 0, lipid 27, muscle 45.5, fibrous tissue 204, and
calcium 245). There was more intraplaque hemorrhage (p<0.001) and
lipid (p=0.002) but less calcium (p<0.001) within symptomatic plaques.
Lipid cores were larger (p=0.005) and their distance from the flow
lumen was lower (p=0.01) in symptomatic plaques. Intraplaque hemorrhage,
lipid, fibromuscular tissue, calcium, lipid core size, and distance
from flow lumen measured by PDA correlated with histology. No significant
inter- or intraobserver variabilities were observed in these measurements.
PDA accurately identified more intraplaque hemorrhage and lipid,
less calcium, and larger lipid cores located closer to the flow lumen
in symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. These data indicate
that PDA may be used to identify high-risk carotid atherosclerotic
plaques and thereby improve the selection of patients requiring treatment.},

abstract = {Purpose: The structural features that underlie carotid plaque disruption
and symptoms are largely unknown. We have previously shown that the
chemical composition and structural complexity of critical carotid
stenoses are related to plaque size regardless of symptoms. To further
determine whether the spatial distribution of individual plaque components
in relation to the lumen corresponds to symptomatic outcome, we evaluated
99 carotid endarterectomy plaques. Methods: Indications for operation
were symptomatic disease in 59 instances (including hemispheric transient
ischemic attack in 29, stroke in 19, and amaurosis fugax in 11) and
angiographic asymptomatic stenosis >75\% in 40. Plaques removed after
remote symp toms beyond 6 months were excluded. Histologic sections
from the most stenotic region of the plaque were examined using computer-assisted
morphometric analysis. The per cent area of plaque cross-section
occupied by necrotic lipid core with or without associated plaque
hematoma, by calcification, as well as the distance from the lumen
or fibrous cap of each of these features, were determined. The presence
of foam cells, macrophages, and inflammatory cell collections within,
on, or just beneath the fibrous cap was taken as an additional indication
of plaque neoformation. Results: The mean percent angiographic stenosis
was 82\% +/- 11\% and 79\% +/- 13\% for the asymptomatic and symptomatic
groups, respectively (p > 0.05). The necrotic core was twice as close
to the lumen in symptomatic plaques when compared with asymptomatic
plaques (0.27 +/- 0.3 mm vs 0.5 +/- 0.5 mm; P < 0.01). The percent
area of necrotic core or calcification was similar for both groups
(22\% vs 26\% and 7\% vs 6\%, respectively). There was no significant
relationship to symptom production of either the distance of calcification
from the lumen or of the percent area occupied by the lipid necrotic
core or calcification. The number of macrophages infiltrating the
region of the fibrous cap was three times greater in the symptomatic
plaques compared with the asymptomatic plaques (1114 +/- 1104 vs
385 +/- 622, respectively, P < 0.009). Regions of fibrous cap disruption
or ulceration were more commonly observed in the symptomatic plaques
than in the asymptomatic plaques (32\% vs 20\%). None of the demographic
or clinical atherosclerosis risk factors distinguished between symptomatic
and asymptomatic plaques. Conclusions: These findings indicate that
proximity of plaque necrotic core to the lumen and cellular indicators
of plaque neoformation or inflammatory reaction about the fibrous
cap are associated with clinical ischemic events. The morphologic
complexity of carotid stenoses does not appear to determine symptomatic
outcome but rather the topography of individual plaque components
in relation to the fibrous cap and the lumen. Imaging techniques
that precisely resolve the position of the necrotic core and evidence
of inflammatory reactions within carotid plaques should help identify
high-risk stenoses before disruption and symptomatic carotid disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effect of age on common carotid artery diameter is
unclear for varying atherosclerosis risk levels. METHODS: Cross-sectional
data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Limited Access
Data set were used to estimate the association of age with B-mode
ultrasound common carotid artery diameter for three atherosclerosis
risk levels. Based on information from clinical examinations, B-mode
ultrasounds, questionnaires, blood and other tests, participants
were categorized into three groups: pre-existing disease (prevalent
stroke and/or coronary heart disease), high risk group (no pre-existing
disease, but prevalent diabetes, hypertension, plaques/shadowing,
body mass index > or = 30, current smoking, or hyperlipidemia), and
a low risk group (no pre-existing disease, no plaques/shadowing,
and no major elevated risk factors). Multivariable linear regression
analyses modeled the common carotid artery diameter relationship
with age. RESULTS: Age was positively and significantly associated
with common carotid artery diameter after risk factor adjustment
in the overall sample, but age had a larger effect among persons
with evidence of atherosclerosis (interaction p < 0.05). Each year
of older age was associated with 0.03 mm larger diameter/year among
persons with pre-existing disease, with 0.027 mm larger diameter/year
in the high risk group, but only 0.017 mm/year among the low risk
group. Results were qualitatively similar using plaques/shadowing
status to indicate atherosclerosis severity. CONCLUSION: The significant
impact of age on common carotid artery diameter among low risk, middle-aged,
black and white men and women suggests arterial remodelling may occur
in the absence of identified risk factors. The significantly larger
impact of age among persons with, compared to persons without identified
atherosclerosis or its risk factors, suggests that arterial remodelling
may be an indicator of exposure duration.},

abstract = {Only a minority of patients with carotid arterial disease have warning
symptoms, because the majority of strokes are caused by previously
asymptomatic lesions. Because morbidity and mortality after acute
stroke are high, patients should be diagnosed and treated before
symptoms develop. The hypothesis of this study is that vascular elasticity
maps (or elastograms) of carotids are of predictive value for plaque
characterization. The strain tensor from either cross-sectional or
longitudinal ultrasound radiofrequency data were assessed by a new
implementation of the Lagrangian speckle model estimator (LSME),
which considers local echogenicity variations. A 26-year-old healthy
male (HS1), a 40-year-old (HS2) normal female subject and two 75-year-old
asymptomatic patients with severe carotid stenoses were scanned.
Reproducible elastograms were obtained as a function of time over
five to seven cardiac cycles. Stress-strain modulus elastograms were
computed for normal subjects. Stiffening of healthy carotid walls
was estimated to be 148 +/- 7 kPa and 163 +/- 30 kPa at peak-systole
for HS1 and HS2, respectively. For patients with heterogeneous plaques,
strain and shear elastograms revealed interesting information about
plaque size, tissue composition and mechanical interaction between
structures. In conclusion, the LSME provides a promising approach
for strain and shear estimates to characterize vulnerable plaque.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Macrophage infiltration and expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9
(MMP-9) are markers of high-risk atherosclerotic carotid plaques
and strong indicators of plaque instability. Use of statins is associated
with a decreased risk of stroke and reportedly improves stability
of atherosclerotic plaques, but available data addressing the mechanism
of this effect are conflicting. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed
data from 94 consecutive patients with internal carotid artery stenosis
who underwent carotid endarterectomy. Excised plaques underwent systematic
quantitative immunohistochemical analysis to determine the percentage
of macrophage area and the percentage of MMP-9 area. Associations
between percentage of macrophage area and percentage of MMP-9 area
and use of statins and cerebrovascular disease were examined by univariate
and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: We found significantly higher
values of percentage of macrophage area and of MMP-9 area in recently
symptomatic (n = 26) compared with asymptomatic (n = 68) internal
carotid artery stenoses: median (IQR) percentage of macrophage area
was 2.29 (1.53-4.129) vs 0.53 (0.27-0.96) and percentage of MMP-9
area was 0.61 (0.36-0.89) vs 0.08 (0.02-0.27; both P < .0005). Patients
treated with statins (n = 49) showed lower percentage values of macrophage
area and MMP-9 area than untreated patients: the percentage of macrophage
area was 0.54 (0.31-1.18) vs 1.03 (0.57-2.08; P = .01) and percentage
of MMP-9 area was 0.06 (0.02-0.22) vs 0.36 (0.16-0.62; P < .0005).
These associations between statin treatment and percentages of macrophage
area and MMP-9 area did not change after controlling for symptomatic
cerebrovascular disease and the effects of other potential confounders
in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the value
of percentage of macrophage area and percentage of MMP-9 area as
markers of plaque instability and provide further evidence to support
the hypothesis that statins reduce inflammatory responses and thereby
stabilize carotid atherosclerotic plaques.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is believed that mechanical stresses play an important
role in atherosclerotic plaque rupture process and may be used for
better plaque vulnerability assessment and rupture risk predictions.
Image-based plaque models have been introduced in recent years to
perform mechanical stress analysis and identify critical stress indicators
which may be linked to rupture risk. However, large-scale studies
based on in vivo patient data combining mechanical stress analysis,
plaque morphology and composition for carotid plaque vulnerability
assessment are lacking in the current literature. METHODS: 206 slices
of in vivo magnetic resonance image (MRI) of carotid atherosclerotic
plaques from 20 patients (age: 49-71, mean: 67.4; all male) were
acquired for model construction. Modified Mooney-Rivlin models were
used for vessel wall and all plaque components with parameter values
chosen to match available data. A morphological plaque severity index
(MPSI) was introduced based on in vivo plaque morphological characteristics
known to correlate with plaque vulnerability. Critical stress, defined
as the maximum of maximum- principal-stress (Stress-P1) values from
all possible vulnerable sites, was determined for each slice for
analysis. A computational plaque stress index (CPSI, with 5 grades
0-4, 4 being most vulnerable) was defined for each slice using its
critical stress value and stress interval for each CPSI grade was
optimized to reach best agreement with MPSI. Correlations between
CPSI and MPSI, plaque cap thickness, and lipid core size were analyzed.
RESULTS: Critical stress values correlated positively with lipid
core size (r = 0.3879) and negatively with cap thickness (r = -0.3953).
CPSI classifications had 71.4\% agreement with MPSI classifications.
The Pearson correlation coefficient between CPSI and MPSI was 0.849
(p < 0.0001). Using global maximum Stress-P1 value for each slice
to define a global maximum stress-based CPSI (G-CPSI), the agreement
rate with MPSI was only 34.0\%. The Pearson correlation coefficient
between G-CPSI and MPSI was 0.209. CONCLUSION: Results from this
in vivo study demonstrated that localized critical stress values
had much better correlation with plaque morphological features known
to be linked to plaque rupture risk, compared to global maximum stress
conditions. Critical stress indicators have the potential to improve
image-based screening and plaque vulnerability assessment schemes.},

abstract = {Non-invasive vascular elastography (NIVE) was recently introduced
to characterize mechanical properties of superficial arteries. In
this paper, the feasibility of NIVE and its applicability in the
context of high-frequency ultrasound imaging is investigated. First,
experiments were performed in vitro on vessel-mimicking phantoms.
Polyvinyl alcohol cryogel was used to create two double-layer vessels
with different mechanical properties. In both cases, the stiffness
of the inner layer was made softer. Radial stress was applied within
the lumen of the phantoms by applying incremental static pressure
steps with a column of a flowing mixture of water-glycerol. The vessel
phantoms were insonified at 32 MHz with an ultrasound biomicroscope
to provide cross-section sequences of radio-frequency (RF) ultrasound
data. The Lagrangian speckle model estimator (LSME) was used to assess
the two-dimensional-strain tensors, and the composite Von Mises elastograms
were computed. A new implementation of the LSME based on the optical
flow equations was introduced. Deformation parameters were estimated
using an inversion algorithm. For each in vitro experiment, both
layers of approximately I rum were distinguished. Second, the use
of the method for the purpose of studying small vessels (MicroNIVE)
in genetically engineered rodents was introduced. Longitudinal scans
of the carotid artery were performed at 40 MHz. The in vivo results
give confidence in the feasibility of MicroNIVE as a potential tool
to non-invasively study the impact of targeted genes on vascular
remodelling in rodents.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: As are the attenuation coefficient and sound speed, the backscatter coefficient is a fundamental ultrasonic property that has been used to characterize many tissues. Unfortunately, there is currently far less standardization for the ultrasonic backscatter measurement than for the other two, as evidenced by a previous American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM)-sponsored interlaboratory comparison of ultrasonic backscatter, attenuation, and speed measurements (J Ultrasound Med 1999; 18:615-631). To explore reasons for these disparities, the AIUM Endowment for Education and Research recently supported this second interlaboratory comparison, which extends the upper limit of the frequency range from 7 to 9 MHz. METHODS: Eleven laboratories were provided with standard test objects designed and manufactured at the University of Wisconsin (Madison, WI). Each laboratory was asked to perform ultrasonic measurements of sound speed, attenuation coefficients, and backscatter coefficients. Each laboratory was blinded to the values of the ultrasonic properties of the test objects at the time the measurements were performed. RESULTS: Eight of the 11 laboratories submitted results. The range of variation of absolute magnitude of backscatter coefficient measurements was about 2 orders of magnitude. If the results of 1 outlier laboratory are excluded, then the range is reduced to about 1 order of magnitude. Agreement regarding frequency dependence of backscatter was better than reported in the previous interlaboratory comparison. For example, when scatterers were small compared with the ultrasonic wavelength, experimental frequency-dependent backscatter coefficient data obtained by the participating laboratories were usually consistent with the expected Rayleigh scattering behavior (proportional to frequency to the fourth power). CONCLUSIONS: Greater standardization of backscatter measurement methods is needed. Measurements of frequency dependence of backscatter are more consistent than measurements of absolute magnitude.},

to this goal by deploying 40 MHz single-element, mechanically rotating

parameters as well as tissue signals will be demonstrated. Subsequently,
we will show that global data normalization is not suited for data
calibration, due to the aforementioned variations as well as the
stringent characteristics of spectral features. We will describe
the sensitivity of an existing feature extraction algorithm based
on eight spectral signatures (integrated backscatter coefficient,
slope, midband-fit (MBF), intercept, and maximum and minimum powers

window size and order of the autoregressive (AR) model. It will be
further demonstrated that the variations in the transducer's spectral
parameters (i.e., center frequency and bandwidth) cause inconsistencies
among extracted features. In this paper, two fundamental questions
are addressed: 1) what is the best reliable way to extract the most
informative features? and 2) which classification algorithm is the
most appropriate for this problem? We will present a full-spectrum
analysis as an alternative to the eight-feature approach. For the

histology. DESIGN: European multicentre study (nine centres). MATERIAL
AND METHODS: Clinical presentation and risk factors were recorded
and preoperative ultrasound Duplex scanning with special emphasis
on B-mode imaging studies was performed in 270 patients undergoing
carotid endarterectomy. Perioperatively, macroscopic plaque features
were evaluated and the removed specimens were analysed histologically
for fibrous tissue, calcification and 'soft tissue' (primarily haemorrhage
and lipid). RESULTS: Males had more soft tissue than females (p =
0.0006), hypertensive patients less soft tissue than normotensive
(p = 0.01) and patients with recent symptoms more soft tissue than
patients with earlier symptoms (p = 0.004). There was no correlation
between surface description on ultrasound images compared to the
surface judged intraoperatively by the surgeon. Echogenicity on B-mode
images was inversely related to soft tissue (p = 0.005) and calcification
was directly related to echogenicity (p < 0.0001). Heterogeneous
plaques contained more calcification than homogeneous (p = 0.003),
however, there was no difference in content of soft tissue. CONCLUSION:
Ultrasound B-mode characteristics are related to the histological
composition of carotid artery plaques and to patient's history. These
results may imply that patients with distant symptoms may be regarded
and treated as asymptomatic patients whereas asymptomatic patients
with echolucent plaques should be considered for carotid endarterectomy.},

world. A correct diagnostic procedure to stratify risk is necessary
in order to rapidly plan the most efficient therapy. The purpose
of this work was to evaluate the agreement between ultrasound echo-color
Doppler (US-ECD) and multidetector-row CT angiography (MDCTA) in
determining the degree of carotid stenosis. Methods and Materials:
From January 2004 to February 2007, 187 patients who had previously
undergone both US-ECD and MDCTA were studied retrospectively. For
each patient, stenosis degree was measured by applying the North
American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria. Data
derived from MDCTA and US-ECD were then compared to calculate the
inter-technique variability by using Cohen kappa statistics. For
all plaque types (fatty, mixed and calcified), inter-technique variability
was assessed. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to highlight
differences between the procedures, and scatterplots were also calculated.
As a gold standard, reference surgical comparisons were performed
in 50 patients. Results: The percentage of observed agreements in
the evaluation of stenosis degree was 72.19\% with a kappa value
of 0.659 (95\% confidence interval: 0.604-0.715) and a weighted kappa
of 0.789. After the evaluating stenosis degree in fatty, mixed and
calcified plaques, the percentages of observed agreements were 79.31,
74.58 and 64.29\%, respectively, with kappa values of 0.738, 0.691
and 0.565. Conclusion: A good agreement between US-ECD and MDCTA
in the evaluation of stenosis degree was observed, together with
a remarkable difference between the 2 techniques in the assessment
both of calcified plaques and of plaques showing a predominant calcific
component.},

Structural analysis of arterial walls is traditionally performed using geometry contours derived from histology. In this paper we demonstrate the first use of a new imaging technique, optical coherence tomography (OCT), as a basis for finite element analysis. There are two primary benefits of OCT relative to histology: 1) imaging is performed without excessive tissue handling, providing a more realistic geometry than histology and avoiding structural artifacts common to histologic processing, and 2) OCT imaging can be performed in vivo, making it possible to study disease progression and the effect of therapeutic treatments in animal models and living patients. Patterns of mechanical stress and strain distributions computed from finite element analysis based on OCT were compared with those from modeling based on "gold standard" histology. Our results indicate that vascular structure and composition determined by OCT provides an adequate basis for investigating the biomechanical factors relevant to atherosclerosis and acute myocardial infarction.},

Data were analyzed with 2-sample t tests and 1-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). RESULTS: ANOVA testing showed a statistically significant
decrease in CT attenuation values with increasing plaque lipid but
with a very high standard deviation of values. No other histological
factor showed a statistically significant link with CT attenuation.
Plaque ulceration was detected by CT with a sensitivity of 60\% and
a specificity of 74\%. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of plaque attenuation
with single-slice spiral CT does not give useful information concerning
plaque composition. The predictive value of CT for the detection
of plaque ulceration was moderate. Single-slice CT angiography is
insufficiently robust to be a useful tool for the characterization
of carotid plaque composition and morphology.},

The aim of our study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity
of 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of the
characteristics of plaque components. Twelve carotid endarterectomy
specimens were imaged by ex-vivo high-resolution 1.5-T MRI. Thirty-four
cross-section axial images were selected for pixel-by-pixel basis
analysis to demonstrate the most significant tissue features. Data
were then submitted for histopathological examination and each specimen
analysed in the light of the histological components (lipid core,
fibrous tissue, fibrous/loose connective tissue, calcifications).
The overall sensitivity and specificity rates for each tissue type
were, respectively, 92\% and 74\% for the lipid core, 82\% and 94\%
for the fibrous tissue, 72\% and 87\% for the fibrous/loose connective
tissue, and 98\% and 99\% for calcification. The use of 1.5-T MRI
appears to be a reliable tool to characterise plaque components and

may change the non-invasive approach to carotid artery diagnostic

abstract = {Cardiac disease and stroke are the major causes of death in the Western
World. Atherosclerosis of the carotid artery is the most important
predictor of stroke. Elastography is a technique to assess the composition
and vulnerability of an atherosclerotic plaque. Contrary to intravascular
applications, the ultrasound beam and radial strain are not aligned
in noninvasive acquisitions. In this study, 2D displacement and strain
images were determined and used to calculate the radial and circumferential
strain. Rf-data were acquired using a Philips SONOS 7500 live 3D
ultrasound system, equipped with an 11\_3L (3 to 11 MHz) linear array
transducer and rf-interface. A homogeneous, hollow cylinder phantom
[20\% gelatin, 1\% SiC scatterers (10 microM)] was measured in a
water tank at different intraluminal pressures. In addition, measurements
in patients (n = 12) were made to evaluate the in vivo applicability
of the technique. Longitudinal and cross-sectional recordings were
made, both in phantoms and patients. Strain along the ultrasound
beam (axial strain) was determined using cross-correlation analysis
for signal-windows from both the pre- and post-compression data.
For lateral strain, new ultrasound lines were generated between the
acquired lines using interpolation. A cross-correlation based search
algorithm was applied to determine lateral displacement and strain.
Longitudinal axial strain images in the phantom showed a decreasing
strain from the lumen- vessel wall interface to the outer region
that can be described by a 1 over r(2) relationship. The lateral
strain image showed no strain in this direction indicating a plane
strain situation. In the cross-sectional view, compression of the
material in regions at 12 and 6 o'clock was observed, whereas expansion
was observed in regions at 3 and 9 o'clock. This pattern is in accordance
with theory, but can only be partly corrected for: in the transition
regions, zero axial strain was measured. The lateral strain image
showed a complementary pattern. In patients, low strain was observed
in nonatherosclerotic artery walls. High and low strain regions were
found in atherosclerotic plaques. High quality elastograms were generated
both in longitudinal and cross-sectional views. In conclusion, 2D
noninvasive elastography of atherosclerotic carotid plaques is feasible.
Phantom studies revealed elastograms in accordance with theory. Additional
in vivo validation is needed to assess the value of this technique
for identifying plaque vulnerability and composition.},

@article{Wasserman2002,
abstract = {Plaque formation begins with the transportation of lipoproteins into
the arterial wall. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) carries most of
the cholesterol in human plasma and becomes trapped within the subendothelial
space of the wall. First, the lipid component of LDL is oxidized,
and this process attracts monocytes to enter the wall and become
macrophages, which further the oxidative process [1]. High-density
lipoprotein (HDL) has been shown to inhibit this oxidative process
[2], thereby providing protection against atherogenesis. Macrophages
also modify the surface protein of LDL, apoprotein B, making it unrecognizable
by the LDL receptor and leading to dysregulation with resultant massive
accumulation of cholesterol [1]. Smooth muscle cells begin to migrate
into the lesion, stimulated by growth factors released by macrophages,
platelets (which may have thrombosed beneath an area of endothelial
injury), endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells [3]. This inflammatory
process results in modified LDL that is taken up by macrophages or
smooth muscle cells, leading to the formation of foam cells. The
accumulation of foam cells and intercellular lipid in the intimal
layer constitutes the first stage of atherosclerosis called the fatty
streak. Many have considered the fatty streak to be the precursor
of fibrous plaque formation; however, some lesions may not develop
further [4]. Virmani et al [5] classify the fatty streak as intimal
xanthomata, which refers to focal accumulations of fat-laden macrophages
within the intima. We know that most intimal xanthomata will regress
because the distribution of lesions in the third decade of life and
beyond is very different from the fatty streaks seen in children
[5]. Fibrous plaque is formed when smooth muscle cells produce a
fibrous cap around the lipid core. The lipid core consists of an
extracellular mass of cholesterol esters, and is lined by foam cells.
The cholesterol esters accumulate as the foam cells consume more
and more lipid, and eventually become necrotic and break apart, partly
because of local hypoxia. The lesion grows by a continued inflammatory
reaction along the shoulder regions adjacent to the edges of the
lipid core. The final stage of atherosclerosis is the complicated
atheroma, which is characterized by the presence of ulceration, intraplaque
hemorrhage, thrombosis, and plates of calcification. Studies of coronary
arteries have shown calcium granules begin deposition immediately
with the formation of the lipid core, although plates and lumps of
calcium form in more advanced lesions [4]. The complicated atheroma
is frequently associated with a clinically acute event.},

of inflammatory cell activity within the plaque. Current imaging
techniques provide anatomic data but no indication of plaque inflammation.
The glucose analogue [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) can be used
to image inflammatory cell activity non-invasively by PET. In this
study we tested whether 18FDG-PET imaging can identify inflammation
within carotid artery atherosclerotic plaques. METHODS AND RESULTS:
Eight patients with symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis were imaged
using 18FDG-PET and co-registered CT. Symptomatic carotid plaques
were visible in 18FDG-PET images acquired 3 hours post-18FDG injection.
The estimated net 18FDG accumulation rate (plaque/integral plasma)
in symptomatic lesions was 27\% higher than in contralateral asymptomatic
lesions. There was no measurable 18FDG uptake into normal carotid
arteries. Autoradiography of excised plaques confirmed accumulation
of deoxyglucose in macrophage-rich areas of the plaque. CONCLUSIONS:
This study demonstrates that atherosclerotic plaque inflammation
can be imaged with 18FDG-PET, and that symptomatic, unstable plaques
accumulate more 18FDG than asymptomatic lesions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Thrombosis on atherosclerotic lesions in the
large extracranial arteries is the main cause of embolization in
the distal cerebral circulation and thus is involved in the pathogenesis
of ischemic stroke. The assessment of biological characteristics
of lesions that are predictive of thrombotic complications might
help in stratification of the risk for stroke but is currently imperfect.
METHODS: We compared the performance of (111)In-platelet scintigraphy
with blood pool subtraction, ultrasound-based tissue texture analyses,
and transcranial Doppler techniques in their ability to predict the
occurrence of superficial thrombosis or the presence of a lipid pool
in carotid artery plaque specimens removed at the time of carotid
endarterectomy in 22 patients with unilateral carotid artery stenosis
of >70\%. RESULTS: Positivity at (111)In-platelet scintigraphy was
present in 8 patients and correctly identified the presence of thrombosis
superimposed on a complicated plaque. Neither tissue texture analysis
nor emboli detection by transcranial Doppler, performed in 12 patients,
significantly identified plaque thrombosis. None of the techniques
used were able to detect the presence of a significant lipid pool
inside the plaque. CONCLUSIONS: Indium-platelet scintigraphy is an
accurate noninvasive diagnostic tool to detect thrombotic complications
in carotid plaques. Prospective studies should assess its ultimate
value in risk stratification, possibly to guide the decision of whether
to perform endarterectomy in selected patient categories.},

with age, brachial SBP, cSBP and AI (r=0.49, 0.28, 0.23; P<0.002

brachial SBP and cSBP (r=0.41, 0.30, 0.22; P<0.003, respectively),
but not with AI. cSBP values were associated with PVH/DWMH grades
2 and 3, but brachial SBP correlated only with grade 3. Mean carotid
intima-media thickness (common carotid arteries (CCA)-IMT) was 0.68+/-0.13
mm. CCA-IMT and plaque score (PS) correlated with PVH/DWMH. Multivariate
regression analysis showed cSBP, age and PS to be independently associated
with PVH and DWMH. Correlation of cSBP with PVH and DWMH was independent
of PS. Central SBP correlated with PVH and DWMH in FLAIR-MRIs and
can better predict WMHs than brachial SBP in earlier stages.Hypertension

Methods to assess plaque vulnerability noninvasively and predict

unsteady models for human atherosclerotic with multi-component plaque
structure and fluid-structure interactions are introduced to perform
mechanical analysis for human atherosclerotic plaques. Results: Stress
variations on critical sites such as a thin cap in the plaque can
be 300\% higher than that at other normal sites. Large calcification
block considerably changes stress/strain distributions. Stiffness
variations of plaque components (50\% reduction or 100\% increase)
may affect maximal stress values by 20-50\%. Plaque cap erosion causes
almost no change on maximal stress level at the cap, but leads to
50\% increase in maximal strain value. Conclusions: Effects caused

which carotid plaque FDG uptake was determined as the ratio of plaque
to blood activity (target to background ratio, TBR). Less than 1
month after imaging, subjects underwent CEA, after which carotid
specimens were processed to identify macrophages (staining with anti-CD68
antibodies). RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between
the PET signal from the carotid plaques and the macrophage staining
from the corresponding histologic sections (r = 0.70; p < 0.0001).
When mean FDG uptake (mean TBR) was compared with mean inflammation
(mean percentage CD68 staining) for each of the 17 patients, the
correlation was even stronger (r = 0.85; p < 0.0001). Fluorodeoxyglucose
uptake did not correlate with plaque area, plaque thickness, or area
of smooth muscle cell staining. CONCLUSIONS: We established that
FDG-PET imaging can be used to assess the severity of inflammation
in carotid plaques in patients. If subsequent natural history studies
link increased FDG-PET activity in carotid arteries with clinical
events, this noninvasive measure could be used to identify a subset
of patients with carotid atherosclerosis in need of intensified medical
therapy or carotid artery intervention to prevent stroke.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thromboembolic disease secondary to complicated carotid
atherosclerotic plaque is a major cause of cerebral ischemia. Clinical
management relies on the detection of significant (>70\%) carotid
stenosis. A large proportion of patients suffer irreversible cerebral
ischemia as a result of lesser degrees of stenosis. Diagnostic techniques
that can identify nonstenotic high-risk plaque would therefore be
beneficial. High-risk plaque is defined histologically if it contains
hemorrhage/thrombus. Magnetic resonance direct thrombus imaging (MRDTI)
is capable of detecting methemoglobin within intraplaque hemorrhage.
We assessed this as a marker of complicated plaque and compared its
accuracy with histological examination of surgical endarterectomy
specimens. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-three patients underwent successful
MRDTI and endarterectomy with histological examination. Of these,
44 were histologically defined as complicated (type VI plaque). MRDTI
demonstrated 3 false-positive and 7 false-negative results, giving
a sensitivity and specificity of 84\%, negative predictive value
of 70\%, and positive predictive value of 93\%. The interobserver
(kappa=0.75) and intraobserver (kappa=0.9) agreement for reading
MRDTI scans was good. CONCLUSIONS: MRDTI of the carotid vessels in
patients with cerebral ischemia is an accurate means of identifying
histologically confirmed complicated plaque. The high contrast generated
by short T1 species within the plaque allows for ease of interpretation,
making this technique highly applicable in the research and clinical
setting for the investigation of carotid atherosclerotic disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES This study theoretically examined the longitudinal structural
determinants of plaque vulnerability using a color-coded stress mapping
technique for several hypothetical vessel models as well as three-dimensional
intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) images with use of a finite element
analysis. BACKGROUND It has been shown that an excessive concentration
of stress is related to atherosclerotic plaque rupture. However,
the local determinants of in-plaque longitudinal stress distribution
along the coronary arterial wall remain unclear. METHODS Using a
finite element analysis, we performed a color mapping of equivalent
stress distribution within plaques for three-dimensional vessel models
as well as longitudinal IVUS plaque images (n = 15). Then, the effects
of plaque size, shape, expansive remodeling, calcification, and lipid
core on the equivalent stress distribution were examined. RESULTS
The color mapping of vessel models revealed a concentration of equivalent
stress at the top of the hills and the shoulders of homogeneous fibrous
plaques. Expansive remodeling and the lipid core augmented the surface
equivalent stress, whereas luminal stenosis and superficial calcification
attenuated the equivalent stress. The location of excessive stress
concentration was modified by the distribution of the lipid core
and calcification. The thickness of the fibrous cap was inversely
related to the equivalent stress within the fibrous cap. However,
the color mapping of IVUS plaque images showed that the equivalent
stress value at the fibrous cap varied with changes in plaque shape
and superficial calcification, even when the thickness of the fibrous
cap remained constant. CONCLUSIONS A distribution analysis of longitudinal
stress revealed specific effects of plaque shape, size, and remodeling,
as well as effects of the interior distribution of tissue components,
on the concentration of stress at the plaque surface. Moreover, fibrous
caps of the same thickness did not consistently represent the same
vulnerability to rupture.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND. Without strong evidence of benefit, the use of carotid
endarterectomy for prophylaxis against stroke rose dramatically until
the mid-1980s, then declined. Our investigation sought to determine
whether carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of stroke among patients
with a recent adverse cerebrovascular event and ipsilateral carotid
stenosis. METHODS. We conducted a randomized trial at 50 clinical
centers throughout the United States and Canada, in patients in two
predetermined strata based on the severity of carotid stenosis--30
to 69 percent and 70 to 99 percent. We report here the results in
the 659 patients in the latter stratum, who had had a hemispheric
or retinal transient ischemic attack or a nondisabling stroke within
the 120 days before entry and had stenosis of 70 to 99 percent in
the symptomatic carotid artery. All patients received optimal medical
care, including antiplatelet therapy. Those assigned to surgical
treatment underwent carotid endarterectomy performed by neurosurgeons
or vascular surgeons. All patients were examined by neurologists
1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after entry and then every 4 months. End
points were assessed by blinded, independent case review. No patient
was lost to follow-up. RESULTS. Life-table estimates of the cumulative
risk of any ipsilateral stroke at two years were 26 percent in the
331 medical patients and 9 percent in the 328 surgical patients--an
absolute risk reduction (+/- SE) 17 +/- 3.5 percent (P less than
0.001). For a major or fatal ipsilateral stroke, the corresponding
estimates were 13.1 percent and 2.5 percent--an absolute risk reduction
of 10.6 +/- 2.6 percent (P less than 0.001). Carotid endarterectomy
was still found to be beneficial when all strokes and deaths were
included in the analysis (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Carotid
endarterectomy is highly beneficial to patients with recent hemispheric
and retinal transient ischemic attacks or nondisabling strokes and
ipsilateral high-grade stenosis (70 to 99 percent) of the internal
carotid artery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Plaque rupture is the principal cause of acute coronary
ischaemia, and unstable carotid plaques are associated with a high
risk of ischaemic stroke. Carotid plaque ulceration also predicts
acute coronary events, suggesting that systemic factors may determine
plaque instability. One potentially important factor is pulse pressure.
There is indirect evidence that cyclical haemodynamic forces affect
plaque stability, and pulse pressure is a strong predictor of coronary
events. OBJECTIVE: To study the association between pulse pressure
and plaque ulceration. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied angiograms
from 3007 patients with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis in
the European Carotid Surgery Trial. Presence of ulceration was related
to the different components of blood pressure [pulse pressure, systolic
blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic
blood pressure (DBP)], and adjustment was made for age, sex, diabetes,
smoking, and the degree of vessel stenosis. RESULTS: Pulse pressure
was the strongest independent predictor of ulceration of the symptomatic
carotid plaque [adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the upper compared with
the lower quintile 2.07, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.25 to 3.44;
P = 0.004]. This relationship was weaker for SBP (OR 1.66, 95\% CI
1.05 to 2.62; P = 0.02), and non-significant for MAP (OR 1.58, 95\%
CI 1.01 to 2.48, P = 0.13) and DBP (OR 1.67, 95\% CI 0.73 to 1.87,
P = 0.50). CONCLUSIONS: Pulse pressure is independently associated
with carotid plaque ulceration, supporting the hypothesis that pulsatile
haemodynamic forces are an important cause of plaque rupture.},

abstract = {A review was undertaken of physical phenomena and the values of associated
physical quantities relevant to arterial ultrasound imaging and measurement.
Arteries are multilayered anisotropic structures. However, the requirement
to obtain elasticity measurements from the data available using ultrasound
imaging necessitates the use of highly simplified constitutive models
involving Young's modulus, E. Values of E are reported for healthy
arteries and for the constituents of diseased arteries. It is widely
assumed that arterial blood flow is Newtonian. However, recent studies
suggest that non-Newtonian behavior has a strong influence on arterial
flow, and the balance of published evidence suggests that non-Newtonian
behavior is associated primarily with red cell deformation rather
than with aggregation. Hence, modeling studies should account for
red cell deformation and the shear thinning effect that this produces.
Published literature in healthy adults gives an average hematocrit
and high-shear viscosity of 0.44 +/- 0.03 and 3.9 +/- 0.6 mPa.s,
respectively. Published data on the acoustic properties of arteries
and blood is sufficiently consistent between papers to allow compilation
and derivation of best-fit equations summarizing the behavior across
a wide frequency range, which then may be used in future modeling
studies. Best-fit equations were derived for the attenuation coefficient
vs. frequency in whole arteries (R2 = 0.995), plasma (R2 = 0.963)

Under this method, compounded elastograms are obtained from a spatially weighted average of local strain estimated from radio frequency (rf) echo signals acquired at different insonification angles. In previous work, the acquisition of the rf signals was performed through the lateral translation of a phased-array transducer. Clinical applications of angular compounding would, however, require the utilization of beam steering on linear-array transducers to obtain angular data sets, which is more efficient than translating phased-array transducers. In this article, we investigate the performance of angular compounding for elastography by using beam steering on a linear-array transducer. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate that spatial angular compounding provides significant improvement in both the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio and the contrast-to-noise ratio. For the linear array transducer used in this study, the optimum angular increment is around 1.5 degrees-3.75 degrees, and the maximum angle that can be used in angular compounding should not exceed 10 degrees.},

significant decrease in the blood flow in the middle cerebral artery

models. Results. Out of the 76 patients examined, 17 (22\%) had new

14 (18\%) were asymptomatic. The multivariate regression models showed
that ME is a potent predictor Of 'silent' ischemic brain lesions,

characterization of the carotid atherosclerotic lesion was attempted
to assess the stability of the plaque. Integrated ultrasonic backscatter
(IBS) in the atherosclerotic lesion was compared with histological
findings of the respective tissue in 35 patients with carotid artery
stenosis who underwent carotid endarterectomy. Carotid IBS was determined
by locating the region-of-interest (ROI) in the center of the atherosclerotic
lesion and calibrating by subtracting the IBS in the tunica externa
of the vessel from the IBS of the ROI. IBS was also determined at
the interface of the plaque, and at this site it was analyzed in
relation to the thickness of the fibrous cap. Lipid content, fibrous
tissue, thrombus, hemorrhage and calcification were histologically
assessed in the respective tissue. Carotid IBS in the lipid lesion
(-22.5+/-4.1 dB) was significantly different from that of fibrous,
hemorrhagic or calcified lesions (-11.1+/-7.1, -27.5+/-4.1, +2.1+/-6.5

a thin fibrous cap, which is frequently associated with unstable

were analysed. RESULTS: global echogenicity was significantly lower
in symptomatic and in CT(+)plaques (p<0.05). For homogenous plaques,
an echogenic cap (EC) was visualised in 8.3\% of symptomatic vs.
33.9\% of asymptomatic (p<0. 05) and in 7.7\% for plaques that were

expression of the potent elastases cathepsins S and K in human atheroma.
Normal arteries contained little or no cathepsin K or S. In contrast,
macrophages in atheroma contained abundant immunoreactive cathepsins
K and S. Intimal smooth muscle cells (SMC), especially cells appearing
to traverse the internal elastic laminae, also contained these enzymes.
Extracts of atheromatous tissues had approximately twofold greater
elastase-specific activity than extracts of uninvolved arteries,
mostly due to cysteine proteases. Cultured human SMC displayed no
immunoreactive cathepsins K and S and exhibited little or no elastolytic
activity when incubated with insoluble elastin. SMC stimulated with
the atheroma-associated cytokines IL-1beta or IFN-gamma secreted
active cathepsin S and degraded substantial insoluble elastin (15-20
microg/10(6) cells/24 h). A selective inhibitor of cathepsin S blocked
> 80\% of this elastolytic activity. The presence of cathepsins K
and S at sites of vascular matrix remodeling and the ability of SMC
and macrophages to use these enzymes to degrade elastin supports
a role for elastolytic cathepsins in vessel wall remodeling and identifies
novel therapeutic targets in regulating plaque stability.},

This study investigates the use of time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TR-LIFS) as a potential tool for detection of macrophage foam cells in the intima of atherosclerotic plaques. Experiments were conducted in vivo on 14 New Zealand rabbits (6 control, 8 hypercholesterolemic) following aortotomy to expose the intimal luminal surface of the aorta. Tissue autofluorescence was induced with a nitrogen pulse laser (337 nm, 1 ns). Lesions were histologically classified by the percent of collagen or macrophage foam cells as well as thickness of the intima. Using parameters derived from the time-resolved fluorescence emission of plaques, we determined that intima rich in macrophage foam cells can be distinguished from intima rich in collagen with high sensitivity (>85\%) and specificity (>95\%). This study demonstrates, for the first time, that a time-resolved fluorescence-based technique can differentiate and demark macrophage content versus collagen content in vivo. Our results suggest that TR-LIFS technique can be used in clinical applications for identification of inflammatory cells important in plaque formation and rupture.},

annote = {SummaryBackground Accurate carotid imaging is important for effective secondary stroke prevention. Non-invasive imaging, now widely available, is replacing intra-arterial angiography for carotid stenosis, but the accuracy remains uncertain despite an extensive literature. We systematically reviewed the accuracy of non-invasive imaging compared with intra-arterial angiography for diagnosing carotid stenosis in patients with carotid territory ischaemic symptoms.Methods We searched for articles published between 1980 and April 2004; included studies comparing non-invasive imaging with intra-arterial angiography that met Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) criteria; extracted data to calculate sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive imaging, to test for heterogeneity and to perform sensitivity analyses; and categorised percent stenosis by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) method.Results In 41 included studies (2541 patients, 4876 arteries), contrast-enhanced MR angiography was more sensitive (0·94, 95\% CI 0·88-0·97) and specific (0·93, 95\% CI 0·89-0·96) for 70-99\% stenosis than Doppler ultrasound, MR angiography, and CT angiography (sensitivities 0·89, 0·88, 0·76; specificities 0·84, 0·84, 0·94, respectively). Data for 50-69\% stenoses and combinations of non-invasive tests were sparse and unreliable. There was heterogeneity between studies and evidence of publication bias.Interpretation Non-invasive tests, used cautiously, could replace intra-arterial carotid angiography for 70-99\% stenosis. However, more data are required to determine their accuracy, especially at 50-69\% stenoses where the balance of risk and benefit for carotid endarterectomy is particularly narrow, and to explore and overcome heterogeneity. Methodology for evaluating imaging tests should be improved; blinded, prospective studies in clinically relevant patients are essential basic characteristics.},

Imaging of coronary atheromatous plaques has traditionally centered on assessing the degree of luminal stenosis. The angiographic techniques that are routinely used to identify stenotic atherosclerotic lesions are unable to identify high-risk plaques; plaques prone to rupture and cause a cardiovascular event. This is partly due to the fact that the majority of culprit lesions that produce acute cardiovascular syndromes are not severely stenotic, possibly due to significant positive remodeling and reduced protective collateral circulation as well as because the risk of plaque rupture is more closely related to plaque content than plaque size. Recently, the focus of new imaging techniques is to identify the high risk plaques; the "vulnerable plaques." In this review, we will refer to the noninvasive and invasive techniques that can detect the vulnerable plaque.},

abstract = {For the noninvasive diagnosis of heart disease based on the acoustic and elastic characteristics of the heart muscle, it is necessary to transcutaneously measure small vibration signals, including components with an amplitude of less than 100 mu m, from various parts of the heart wall continuously for periods of more than several heartbeats in a wide frequency range up to 1 kHz. Such measurement, however, has not been realized by any ultrasonic diagnostic methods or systems to date, By introducing the constraint least-square approach, this paper proposes a new method for accurately tracking the movement of the heart wall based on both the phase and magnitude of the demodulated signal to determine the instantaneous position of the object so that the vibration velocity of the moving object can be accurately estimated, By this method, small vibrations of the heart wall with small amplitudes less than 100 mu m on the motion resulting from a heartbeat with large amplitude of 10 mm can be successfully detected with sufficient reproducibility in the frequency range up to several hundred Hertz continuously for periods of about 10 heartbeats, The resultant small vibration is analyzed not only in the time domain, but also in the frequency domain. As confirmed by the preliminary experiments herein reported, the new method offers potential for research in acoustical diagnosis of heart disease.},

Scatterer size images are computed from the frequency dependence
of sigma b and a correlation model function that describes the structure

are computed from the absolute magnitude of sigma b. Chi-square images
are generated to display how well the correlation model represents
the interrogated medium. Integrated backscatter coefficient images
are formed over the transducer bandwidth. All four images are generated
simultaneously and compared with the corresponding B-mode image.
Test samples with known physical properties were used to demonstrate
experimentally that accurate parametric images are possible if an
accurate correlation model is used. Local variations in attenuation,
the center frequency and bandwidth of the transducer, and the distribution
of scatterer sizes greatly influence the accuracy of estimates and
the appearance of the image, thus demonstrating the importance of
these factors in parametric image interpretation.},

abstract = {Intravascular ultrasound elastography is a method for measuring the
local elastic properties using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). The
elastic properties of the different tissues within the atherosclerotic
plaque are measured through the strain. Knowledge of these elastic
properties is useful for guiding interventional procedures (balloon
dilatation, ablation) and detection of the vulnerable plaque. In
the last decade, several groups have applied elastography intravascularly
with various levels of success. In this paper, the approaches of
the different research groups will be discussed. The focus will be
on our approach to the application of intravascular elastography,
Elastograms were acquired in vitro and in vivo using the relative
local displacements between IVUS images acquired at two levels of
intravascular pressure with a 30 MHz mechanical or a 20 MHz array
echo catheter. These displacements were estimated from the time shift
between gated radiofrequency echo signals using cross-correlation
algorithms with interpolation around the peak. Experiments on gel-based
phantoms mimicking atherosclerotic vessels demonstrated the capability
of elastography to identify soft and hard tissues independently of
the echogenicity contrast. In vitro experiments on human arteries
have demonstrated the potential of intravascular elastography to
identify different plaque types based on their mechanical properties.
These plaques could not be identified using the IVUS image alone.
In vivo experiments revealed that reproducible elastograms could
be obtained near end-diastole. Partial validation using the echogram
was performed. Intravascular elastography provides information that
is frequently unavailable or inconclusive from the IVUS image and
which may therefore assist in the diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerotic
disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic lesions are heterogeneous and prognosis
cannot easily be predicted, even with intracoronary ultrasound and
angioscopy. Serial angiographic and necropsy studies suggest that
the risk of plaque rupture correlates only weakly with the degree
of stenosis. Most ruptured plaques are characterised by a large pool
of cholesterol or necrotic debris and a thin fibrous cap with a dense
infiltration of macrophages. The release of matrix-digesting enzymes
by these cells is thought to contribute to plaque rupture. Other
thromboses are found on non-ruptured but inflamed plaque surfaces.
We postulated that both types of thrombotic events may be predicted
by heat released by activated macrophages either on the plaque surface
or under a thin cap. METHODS: To test the hypothesis, we measured
the intimal surface temperatures at 20 sites in each of 50 samples
of carotid artery taken at endarterectomy from 48 patients. The living
samples were probed with a thermistor (24-gauge needle-tip; accuracy
0.1 degree C; time contrast 0.15 s). The tissues were then fixed
and stained. FINDINGS: Plaques showed several regions in which the
surface temperatures varied reproducibly by 0.2-0.3 degrees C, but
37\% of plaques had substantially warmer regions (0.4-2.2 degrees
C). Points with substantially different temperatures could not be
distinguished from one another by the naked eye; such points could
also be very close to one another (< 1 mm apart). Temperature correlated
positively with cell density (r = 0.68, p = 0.0001) and inversely
with the distance of the cell clusters from the luminal surface (r
= -0.38, p = 0.0006). Most cells were macrophages. Infrared thermographic
images also revealed heterogeneity in temperature among the plaques.
INTERPRETATION: Living atherosclerotic plaques show thermal heterogeneity,
which raises the possibility that an infrared catheter or other techniques
that can localise heat or metabolic activity might be able to identify
plaques at high risk of rupture or thrombosis.},

Cross sectional case-control study. SETTING: Secondary care old age
psychiatry services, Manchester. PARTICIPANTS: 170 patients with
dementia (85 with Alzheimer's disease, 85 with vascular dementia)
and 150 age and sex matched controls. Patients on anticoagulant treatment,
patients with severe dementia, and controls with marked cognitive
impairment were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequencies of detection
of spontaneous cerebral emboli during one hour monitoring of the
middle cerebral arteries with transcranial Doppler and venous to
arterial circulation shunts by a transcranial Doppler technique using
intravenous microbubbles as an ultrasound contrast. RESULTS: Spontaneous
cerebral emboli were detected in 32 (40\%) of patients with Alzheimer's
disease and 31 (37\%) of those with vascular dementia compared with
just 12 each (15\% and 14\%) of their controls, giving significant
odds ratios adjusted for vascular risk factors of 2.70 (95\% confidence
interval 1.18 to 6.21) for Alzheimer's disease and 5.36 (1.24 to
23.18) for vascular dementia. These spontaneous cerebral emboli were
not caused by carotid disease, which was equally frequent in dementia
patients and their controls. A venous to arterial circulation shunt
indicative of patent foramen ovale was found in 27 (32\%) Alzheimer's
disease patients and 25 (29\%) vascular dementia patients compared
with 19 (22\%) and 17 (20\%) controls, giving non-significant odds
ratios of 1.57 (0.80 to 3.07) and 1.67 (0.81 to 3.41). CONCLUSION:
Spontaneous cerebral emboli were significantly associated with both
Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. They may represent a potentially
preventable or treatable cause of dementia.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite great advances in our knowledge, atherosclerosis
continues to kill more people than any other disease in the Western
world. This is because our means of identifying truly vulnerable
patients is limited. Prediction of atherosclerotic plaque rupture
may be addressed by MRI of activated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
a family of enzymes that have been implicated in the vulnerability
of plaques prone to rupture. This study evaluated the ability of
the novel gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent P947 to target MMPs
in atherosclerotic plaques. METHODS AND RESULTS: The affinity of
P947 toward activated MMPs was demonstrated in vitro. The affinity
and specificity of P947 toward matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-rich
plaques was evaluated both in vivo using ApoE-/- mice and ex vivo
in hyperlipidemic rabbits. Gadolinium content quantification and
MRI showed a preferential accumulation of P947 in atherosclerotic
lesions compared with the nontargeted reference compound, Gd-DOTA.
The ex vivo assay on rabbit plaques revealed a higher uptake of P947.
Moreover, using human carotid artery endarterectomy specimens, P947
facilitated discrimination between histologically defined MMP-rich
and MMP-poor plaques. An in vivo MRI investigation in mice revealed
that P947 greatly improved the ability to visualize and delineate
atherosclerotic plaques. CONCLUSIONS: P947 may be a useful tool for
the detection and characterization of the MMP-rich atherosclerotic
plaques.},

@article{Wootton1999,
abstract = {The cardiovascular system is an internal flow loop with multiple branches
circulating a complex liquid. The hallmarks of blood flow in arteries
are pulsatility and branches, which cause wail stresses to be cyclical
and nonuniform. Normal arterial flow is laminar, with secondary flows
generated at curves and branches. Arteries can adapt to and modify
hemodynamic conditions, and unusual hemodynamic conditions may cause
an abnormal biological response. Velocity profile skewing can create
pockets in which the wall shear stress is low and oscillates in direction.
Atherosclerosis tends to localize to these sites and creates a narrowing
of the artery lumen-a stenosis. Plaque rupture or endothelial injury
can stimulate thrombosis, which can block blood flow to heart or
brain tissues, causing a heart attack or stroke. The small lumen
and elevated shear rate in a stenosis create conditions that accelerate
platelet accumulation and occlusion. The relationship between thrombosis
and fluid mechanics is complex, especially in the post-stenotic flow
field. New convection models have been developed to predict clinical
occlusion from platelet thrombosis in diseased arteries. Future hemodynamic
studies should address the complex mechanics of flow-induced, large-scale

abstract = {Background: Noninvasive vascular ultrasound elastography (NIVE) was recently introduced to assess mechanical properties (strain or elasticity) of peripheral vessel walls. The goal of this study was to determine strain values in subjects with normal carotid arteries and the reproducibility of these measurements. Methods: Sixteen individuals without previous history of carotid atherosclerosis were recruited in four age categories [40-49], [50-59], [60-69], and [70-79] years old. The left and right common and internal carotids (LCC, LIC, RCC, and RIC, respectively) were independently scanned by two radiologists (RAD-A and RAD-B). The axial strain elastograms were computed with the Lagrangian speckle model estimator. Results: Supported by Bland-Altman analyses, strain values between LCC and RCC were found similar with a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.83 (p \&lt; 0.0001). Equivalently, a good correlation was found between RAD-A and RAD-B for common carotids with r=0.80 (p \&lt; 0.0001). Lower strain values (p \&lt; 0.001) were measured for male common carotids (1.62 +/- 0.32\%) than females (2.21 +/- 0.76\%). Regarding the internal carotid strain measurements, the correlation was lower between RAD-A and RAD-B with r=0.52 (p=0.01), but drastically decreased between LIC and RIC (r=0.16, nonsignificant). Male internal carotid strain estimates (p=0.03) were lower (1.48 +/- 0.44\%) than in females (1.84 +/- 0.64\%). Additionally, male common and internal carotid mean elastic moduli varied from 33-106 kPa, whereas it covered a range of 25-67 kPa for females. Female carotids were more elastic (44 +/- 17 kPa) than males (58 +/- 17 kPa, p \&lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Strain measurements in common carotids were found reproducible. However, less consistency was observed for the deeper internal carotids. The NIVE imaging method still remains to be validated with pathological cases, but it might provide a unique approach for stroke prevention and characterization of vascular stiffness.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the physical properties of atherosclerotic
plaque is essential when evaluating its vulnerability in a clinical
setting. Such knowledge, however, is still difficult to obtain with
the various approaches developed to date. METHODS AND RESULTS: This
article describes a noninvasive method for evaluating the regional
elasticity (the elastic modulus in the circumferential direction)
of tissue surrounding atherosclerotic plaque in which a novel phased
tracking method is applied to measure minute changes in thickness
of each of the multiple layers of the arterial wall during one heartbeat.
By comparing the pathological findings with the distribution of elasticity,
average elasticity of lipid and that of a mixture of smooth muscle
and collagen fiber can be determined. On the basis of these reference
parameters, each point is statistically categorized as lipid, mixture,
or other. Thus, the plaque is electronically stained using transcutaneous
ultrasound. By applying the method to the common carotid arteries,
the presence of thin collagen fiber was clarified along the arterial
axis for normal subjects, whereas soft inclusion of lipid was found
for every plaque in subjects with hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSIONS: This
novel method offers potential as a diagnostic technique for detection
of plaque vulnerability with high spatial resolution.},

abstract = {Thermal strain imaging (TSI) is demonstrated in two model systems
mimicking two potential clinical applications. First, a custom ultrasound
(US) microscope produced high-resolution TSI images of an excised
porcine coronary artery. Samples were placed in a temperature-controlled
water chamber and scanned transversely and longitudinally. Phase-sensitive,
correlation-based speckle tracking was applied to map the spatial
distribution of temporal strain across the sample. TSI differentiated
fatty tissue from water-based arterial wall and muscle with high
contrast and a spatial resolution of 60 microm for a 50-MHz transducer.
Both transverse and longitudinal TSI images compared well with B-scans
of arterial wall structures, including intima, media, adventitia,
and overlying fatty tissue. A second model system was used to test
the hypothesis that US can produce the heating pattern required for
TSI of internal structures. A 2-D phased array with independent drive
electronics was combined with a conventional US scanner (iU22, Philips,
Bothell, WA) for these studies. This 513-element array, originally
designed for the US therapy, acted as the US heat source. To quantify
the temporal strain induced by this system, TSI was performed on
a homogeneous rubber phantom. TSI temperature estimates were within
3\% error for a 3.2 degrees C temperature rise produced within 2
s using a specially designed beamformer and pulse sequencer. The
system was then used to produce TSI scanning of an excised kidney
containing an intact piece of fat below the collecting system. These
images were validated using an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pulse
sequence designed for lipid quantification. TSI scans matched well
MRI scans and histology both anatomically and quantitatively. Finally,
to test the potential of US-induced TSI for a significant clinical
problem, images were obtained on an excised canine aorta with fatty
tissue inside the lumen. Both longitudinal and transversal TSI agreed
well with anatomy. These in vitro results demonstrate the potential
of high-resolution US-induced TSI with a small temperature change
(<1 degrees C) for plaque characterization.},

abstract = {It is believed that atherosclerotic plaque rupture may be related
to maximal stress conditions in the plaque. More careful examination
of stress distributions in plaques reveals that it may be the local
stress/strain behaviors at critical sites such as very thin plaque
cap and locations with plaque cap weakness that are more closely
related to plaque rupture risk. A local maximal stress hypothesis
and a stress-based computational plaque vulnerability index (CPVI)
are proposed to assess plaque vulnerability. A critical site selection
(CSS) method is proposed to identify critical sites in the plaque

values. Our initial results based on 34 2D MRI slices from 14 human
coronary plaque samples indicate that CPVI plaque assessment has
an 85\% agreement rate (91\% if the square root of stress values
is used) with assessment given by histopathological analysis. Large-scale
and long-term patient studies are needed to further validate our
findings for more accurate quantitative plaque vulnerability assessment.},

characterization (UTC) to discriminate between plaques from asymptomatic

measurements of plaque morphology. A total of 34 plaque specimens
removed at carotid endarterectomy were scanned transversely at intervals
of 1 mm, and compared to tissue cross-sections examined by optical
microscopy employing computer-assisted planimetry. UTC was performed
by spectral analysis of backscattered radiofrequency signals. The
slope, intercept and total power parameters of the spectrum were
evaluated. Discriminant analysis was used to compare the ability
of the UTC spectral parameters and morphological constituents to
correctly classify plaques according to their symptom group membership.
UTC correctly classified 88.2\% of the plaques. Thrombus was present
in 93.9\% of the plaques, and there was little difference in the
morphological constituents of plaques from asymptomatic and symptomatic
patients. Morphological constituents correctly classified 60.7\%
of the plaques. We conclude, in this preliminary study, that UTC
can discriminate between carotid plaques from asymptomatic and symptomatic
patients with moderate accuracy, despite a similarity in their morphological
composition. UTC discrimination is not related to differences in
the type or amount of morphological constituents in the plaques.

abstract = {Plaque rupture has become identified as a critical step in the evolution
of arterial plaques, especially as clinically significant events
occur in critical arteries. It has become common in the past dozen
years or so to consider which plaques are vulnerable, even though
not yet ruptured. Thrombotic events have remained significant, but
in a context where they are seen as being triggered often by plaque
rupture. Weaving together considerations from structural mechanics,
fluid mechanics, plaque morphology, epidemiological pathology, micromechanical
measurements of arterial wall tissues, and emerging information on
the complex roles of the matrix metalloproteinases, this critical
review draws attention to the relative paucity of data (i) on the
mechanical behavior of small test portions of arterial tissues and
(ii) on the relation of plaque locations to local vessel curvature
and curvature flexure. This is especially important in the epicardial
arteries, where combination of biplane angiograms and intravascular
ultrasound (both becoming increasingly available in digital recordings)
offer opportunities for clinical investigation, allied to biomechanics,
to an extent previously not possible. Improved imaging and local
tissue property assessments provide related opportunities for the
carotid bifurcation. The discussion includes a proposal for developing
an assessment scale for plaque vulnerability.},

abstract = {Accurate estimates of stress in an atherosclerotic lesion require knowledge of the material properties of its components (e.g., normal wall, fibrous plaque, calcified regions, lipid pools) that can only be approximated. This leads to considerable uncertainty in these computational predictions. A study was conducted to test the sensitivity of predicted levels of stress and strain to the parameter values of plaque used in finite element analysis. Results show that the stresses within the arterial wall, fibrous plaque, calcified plaque, and lipid pool have low sensitivities for variation in the elastic modulus. Even a +/- 50\% variation in elastic modulus leads to less than a 10\% change in stress at the site of rupture. Sensitivity to variations in elastic modulus is comparable between isotropic nonlinear, isotropic nonlinear with residual strains, and transversely isotropic linear models. Therefore, stress analysis may be used with confidence that uncertainty in the material properties generates relatively small errors in the prediction of wall stresses. Either isotropic nonlinear or anisotropic linear models provide useful estimates, however the predictions in regions of stress concentration (e.g., the site of rupture) are somewhat more sensitive to the specific model used, increasing by up to 30\% from the isotropic nonlinear to orthotropic model in the present example. Changes resulting from the introduction of residual stresses are much smaller.},

abstract = {Plaque rupture is correlated with the plaque morphology, composition,
mechanical properties, and with the blood pressure. Whereas the geometry
can accurately be assessed with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging,
intravascular elastography (IVE) is capable of extracting information
on the plaque local mechanical properties and composition. This paper
reports additional IVE validation data regarding reproducibility
and potential to characterize atherosclerotic plaques and mural thrombi.
In a first investigation, radio frequency (RF) data were acquired
from the abdominal aorta of an atherosclerotic rabbit model. In a
second investigation, IVUS RF data were recorded from the left coronary
artery of a patient referred for angioplasty. In both cases, Galaxy
IVUS scanners (Boston Scientific, Freemont, CA), equipped with 40
MHz Atlantis catheters, were used. Elastograms were computed using
two methods, the Lagrangian speckle model estimator (LSME) and the
scaling factor estimator (SFE). Corroborated with histology, the
LSME and the SFE both clearly detected a soft thrombus attached to
the vascular wall. Moreover, shear elastograms, only available with
the LSME, confirmed the presence of the thrombus. Additionally, IVE
was found reproducible with consistent elastograms between cardiac
cycles (CCs). Regarding the human dataset, only the LSME was capable
of identifying a plaque that presumably sheltered a lipid core. Whereas
such an assumption could not be certified with histology, radial
shear and tangential strain LSME elastograms enabled the same conclusion.
It is worth emphasizing that this paper reports the first ever in
vivo tangential strain elastogram with regards to vascular imaging,
due to the LSME. It is concluded that the IVE was reproducible exhibiting
consistent strain patterns between CCs. The IVE might provide a unique
tool to assess coronary wall lesions.},

designed specifically for imaging the carotid bifurcation and compared
with the existing four-channel (4PA) design using a phantom and by
in vivo black-blood magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The 8PA and
4PA were compared in terms of coverage, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). RESULTS: The 8PA showed up to
1.7-fold improvement in SNR at a depth of 3.5 cm and greater longitudinal
coverage at a given SNR on a phantom. The 8PA showed improved vessel
wall SNR for high spatial resolution (0.63 mm(2)) PD, T1, and T2

was more likely in patients with any history of tobacco use (odds

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ulceration is a severe complication of carotid
plaque. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role and the
diagnostic efficacy of multidetector row CT angiography (MDCTA) and
ultrasound (US) echo color Doppler (US-ECD) in the study of patients
with carotid plaque complicated by ulceration through the comparison
with the surgical observation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January
2004 to October 2005, 237 patients, for a total of 474 carotid arteries,
studied at first with color Doppler US, were analyzed using CT angiography.
A total of 103 patients underwent a carotid endarterectomy. We analyzed
stenosis degree, plaque composition, and presence of ulcerations.
In a second phase, the data were compared with the surgical results
when the MDCTA indicated surgical intervention. RESULTS: MDCTA found
31 ulcerations; the surgical confirmation underlined a 93.75\% sensitivity
and a 98.59\% specificity. US-ECD performances were 37.5\% and 91.5\%
for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The number of patients
who showed plaque ulcerations increased with the severity of stenosis.
Furthermore, ulcerations of the carotid plaque occurred more often
proximal than distal to the point of maximum stenosis, and this trend
increased with the severity of the stenosis. We also determined that
fatty plaques were more likely to be affected by ulcerations. CONCLUSIONS:
The results of our study suggest that MDCTA detects with higher sensitivity
and specificity the presence of ulcerated plaque compared with US-ECD,
which has been demonstrated to be less effective in this evaluation.
Considering the high MDCTA sensitivity and specificity for detection
of plaque ulceration, we therefore recommend MDCTA as a useful step
for correct presurgical planning.},

that obtains the local mechanical properties of the artery wall and

of these mechanical properties may provide crucial information that

Here, we present a new method to estimate the transverse strain tensor
of the arterial wall based on nonrigid image registration using IVUS
images. This method registers a pair of images acquired at a vessel
site under different levels of luminal pressure. The 2-D displacement
field in the vessel cross-section is estimated from image registration;
then the displacement field is used to calculate the 2-D local strain
tensor. From the strain tensor, the strain in any direction in the
cross-section can be obtained; here, the radial and circumferential
strain distributions are presented. This strain estimation method
has been validated with synthetic motion IVUS images and evaluated
using the IVUS images of a polyvinyl alcohol cryogel phantom. The
accuracy of the estimated strain and the ability of the method to
overcome IVUS system noise are demonstrated. (E-mail: mhfriedm\_at\_duke.edu)

These plaques are characterized by a lipid-rich core with abundant inflammatory cells and a thin fibrous cap. Thermal strain imaging (TSI) using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has been proposed for high-risk arterial plaque detection, in which image contrast results from the temperature dependence of sound speed. It has the potential to distinguish a lipid-laden lesion from the arterial vascular wall due to its strong contrast between water-bearing and lipid-bearing tissue. Initial simulations indicate plaque identification is possible for a 1 degrees C temperature rise. A phantom experiment using an IVUS imaging array further supports the concept, and results agree reasonably well with prediction.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to develop methods for quantitative ultrasound
imagery suitable for noninvasive assessment of carotid plaque composition
prior to the selection of the technique for revascularization. Using
two broadband transducers (5-12 MHz and 12-28 MHz), backscattered
radio frequency signals were acquired from entire lengths of 15 carotid
endarterectomy specimens. Spectral analysis methods with correction
for system response and beam diffraction were applied to radio frequency
signals from local volumes of plaque having a 2 mm slice thickness,
1 mm width and axial depth of 480 microm and 240 microm at 10 MHz
and 20 MHz, respectively. From these spectra, local values of four
ultrasound parameters (integrated backscatter, frequency dependence
of backscatter, integrated attenuation and slope of attenuation)
were estimated and used to construct quantitative images. To combine
information from these different parameter images, a two-step approach
was followed. First, in 59 independent quantitative images of highly
stenotic plaque, the average parameter values in a central five-by-three
pixel region were correlated with plaque composition as assessed
by histology to investigate the relationship between parameter values,
frequency bandwidth and plaque composition. Discriminant analysis
of parameter values vs. plaque composition was made to find a set
of predictive equations to classify sets of measurements. Correct
classification was obtained for 100\% of calcified, 75\% of intraplaque
hemorrhage and 71\% of lipidic plaques of the input data set. Second,
each set of pixels from different parameter images was classified
using the predictive equations, and a single, local tissue composition
image was constructed. Examples of tissue composition images are
presented in comparison with corresponding histologic sections. Both
agreement and disagreement between image pairs are discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammation is a key mechanism in human atherosclerotic
plaque vulnerability and disruption. The objective was to determine
the differential gene expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory factors
in the fibrous cap and shoulder region of noncalcified and calcified
carotid endarterectomy plaques. METHODS: Thirty carotid endarterectomy
plaques were classified as type Va (noncalcified, n = 15) and type
Vb (calcified, n = 15) in accordance with the American Heart Association
consensus. Using laser capture microdissection, fibrous cap and shoulder
regions were excised from frozen sections. Gene expression of pro-
[interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein
1 (MCP-1)] and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) factors, and bone formation
(bone morphogenetic protein 6 and osteocalcin) mediators were quantitated
by real-time PCR. Protein levels were determined using Western blotting.
RESULTS: Mean percent carotid stenosis and calcification area were
79 and 5\% in Va-plaques (40\% symptomatic) and 77 and 42\% in Vb-plaques
(20\% symptomatic). Macrophages infiltrating the region of the fibrous
cap and the shoulder were more numerous in non-calcified plaques
compared with calcified plaques (p < 0.01]. mRNA expression of MCP-1
and IL-8, and protein levels of IL-8 were also greater in Va plaques
compared to Vb plaques (p < 0.05). Protein levels and mRNA expression
of osteocalcin were greater in Vb compared to Va plaques (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Fibrous cap inflammation is more likely to occur in
noncalcified than in calcified plaques. These findings suggest that
carotid atherosclerotic plaque calcification is a structural marker
of plaque stability.},

The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of atherosclerotic plaque development on the morphological and mechanical characteristics of the aortic vessel wall in a pre-clinical murine model of atherosclerosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Groups of apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) and C57BL/6J control mice fed a high-fat diet were monitored over a 12-week time period by high-field MRI. Multi-Slice-Multi-Spin-Echo and Phase-Contrast MRI sequences were employed to track changes to aortic vessel wall area, blood flow velocity and distensibility. RESULTS: After 6- and 12-weeks, significant changes in vessel wall area and circumferential strain were detected in the apoE(-/-) mice relative to the control animals. Blood flow velocity and intravascular lumen remained unchanged in both groups, findings that are in agreement with the theory of positive remodeling of the ascending aorta during plaque progression. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated the application of high-field MRI for characterizing the temporal progression of morphological and mechanical changes to murine aortic vasculature associated with atherosclerotic lesion development.},

(US). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 4, 886 individuals who,
at baseline, were 65 years of age or older and without symptoms of
cerebrovascular disease was followed up for an average of 3.3 years.
Baseline clinical findings were from color Doppler and duplex US
studies of the carotid arteries and a record of traditional risk
factors: age, sex, presence of diabetes mellitus, pack-years of cigarette
smoking, presence of hypertension, elevated systolic and diastolic
blood pressure, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level.
RESULTS: Incident strokes, excluding hemorrhagic strokes and strokes
of cardiac origin, were seen in 104 individuals (2.1\%) at risk.
Age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios for incident stroke were significant
for hypoechoic plaque (odds ratio, 2.53; 95\% CI, 1,42,4.53). After
controlling for risk factors in a Cox proportional hazards model,
the relative risk (RR) of incident stroke was 1.72 (p = .015) for
hypoechoic plaque and 2.32 (P = .004) for internal carotid arterial
narrowing of at least 50\%. In addition, hypoechoic plaque (RR, 2.78;
CI, 1.36,5.69) and 50\%-100\% stenosis (RR, 3.08; CI, 1.28, 7.41)
were associated with ipsilateral, nonfatal stroke. CONCLUSION: In
asymptomatic adults aged 65 years or older, that risk of incident
stroke was associated with two US features: hypoechoic internal carotid
arterial plaque and an estimated internal carotid arterial stenosis
of 50\%-100\%.},

abstract = {In elastography, an erroneous strain estimate is obtained when the radial strain and the probing ultrasound beam are not properly aligned: the "strain projection artifact". In practice, an angle between the strain and the ultrasound beam will be present in most of the cases due to inhomogeneities or nonuniform compression. In this study, a theoretical function describing the strain projection artifact is derived as a function of the angle between the radial strain and the ultrasound beam. Two main factors for an angle between strain and ultrasound beam in intravascular elastographic experiments are eccentricity and tilt of the transducer. The theoretical functions describing these errors are corroborated with strain estimates from an experiment with a circular, homogeneous gel-based vessel phantom. Comparison between the theoretical functions and the experimental results reveals that the strain projection artifact is well described by the theoretical findings. As a result, the experimental data can be corrected for this artifact. The corrected elastograms reveal that correct strain estimates are obtained when the eccentricity of the intravascular catheter is less than 63\%. An "off-the-wall" device may be required to advance intravascular elastography to in vivo implementation.},

abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that
may involve the whole gut. Marked intestinal T cell and macrophage
activation is a key feature of the disease. Polymorphonuclear cell
infiltration is also observed in the diseased gut, mainly during
active inflammation. Scintigraphic detection of granulocytes and
activated lymphocytes infiltrating the gut wall may be useful in
identifying a subgroup of patients with clinically inactive CD who
are undergoing early clinical relapse. The aims of the present study
were (a) to compare the effectiveness of scintigraphy with (99m)Tc-labelled
interleukin-2 ((99m)Tc-IL2) and with (99m)Tc-HMPAO labelled granulocytes
((99m)Tc-WBC) in detecting the presence and extent of bowel inflammation
in patients with long-term inactive CD (>12 months) and (b) to assess
the accuracy of these techniques in predicting future disease relapse.
We studied 29 patients with ileal and/or colonic CD in stable clinical
remission (Crohn's Disease Activity Index <150 for at least 12 months)
using both (99m)Tc-IL2 and (99m)Tc-WBC scintigraphy in order to evaluate
the extent of acute and chronic inflammation in the bowel. Planar
and single-photon emission tomography images were acquired in each
patient at 1 h p.i. For quantitative analysis of (99m)Tc-IL2 uptake,
the abdomen was divided into 32 regions of interest. Despite the
absence of symptoms, 18 patients (62\%) showed a positive (99m)Tc-IL2
and 18 (62\%) a positive (99m)Tc-WBC scan. Only 12 patients (41.4\%
of the total group) were positive on both scans, and the sites of
IL2 and granulocyte bowel uptake were usually located in different
segments, indicating that in CD, acute and chronic inflammation can
be present in different sites. As far as the prognostic role of the
two scans in predicting future disease relapse is concerned, both
(99m)Tc-IL2 and (99m)Tc-WBC scintigraphy showed a high negative predictive
value (1.00 and 0.91, respectively) but a weak positive predictive
value (0.44 and 0.39, respectively). Nevertheless, Kaplan-Meier curves
generated between scintigraphic findings and time free from disease
relapse were statistically different only for (99m)Tc-IL2 scintigraphy
(log-rank test, P=0.013). These results indicate that (99m)Tc-IL2
scintigraphy can be useful in selecting CD patients in clinical remission
who could benefit from preventive therapy to avoid disease relapse.},

abstract = {Stroke is the third most common cause of mortality in the United States

As a means to prevent cerebrovascular events, current concepts advocate
endarterectomy or carotid stenting in patients with advanced carotid
disease. Arterial stenosis alone has been shown to be a poor predictor
of cardiovascular events and therefore both arterial stenosis and
patient symptom status are taken as indications for interventional
therapy. Several studies have shown that symptomatic subjects benefit
more from a carotid endarterectomy than asymptomatic subjects: 3-6
carotid endarterectomies are needed to prevent one stroke per year
in symptomatic subjects with > 70 \% stenosis compared to 14 - 17
carotid endarterectomies in asymptomatic patients with > 50 \% stenosis.
It is commonly accepted today that factors other than the degree
of luminal stenosis can determine a patient's symptom status, such
as the composition or the superficial structure of atherosclerotic
plaque. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging has overcome the
limitations of current angiographic techniques and has emerged as
a leading non-invasive imaging modality for atherosclerotic disease,
especially within carotid arteries and other large vessels. In this
review, the state of the art in MRI of atherosclerosis is presented
in terms of hardware and image acquisition protocols. Also, the results
of validation studies for measuring lesion size, composition and

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The present study examined the association between carotid
atherosclerosis, coronary atherosclerosis and common carotid artery
intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) in patients with incident ischemic
stroke and its subtypes (75 cases and 21 controls). METHODS: Cases
with ischemic brain infarctions (IBIs) were consecutively recruited
and classified into subtypes by computed tomography and Bamford's
classification (the size and site of the infarct) as one of the following:
total anterior circulation infarcts (TACIs); partial anterior circulation
infarcts (PACIs); posterior circulation infarcts (POCIs); and lacunar
infarcts. Controls were recruited among individuals hospitalized
for a reason other than cerebrovascular disease at the same institutions
and matched for age and sex. Patients and controls underwent B-mode
ultrasonographic measurements of CCA-IMT, and were evaluated by a
qualified internist and neurologist for the presence of ischemic
coronary disease and a history of previous stroke or transient ischemic
attack. RESULTS: Of the 75 patients with an acute ischemic stroke,
10 (14\%) were classified as TACIs, 34 (45\%) as PACIs, 12 (16\%)
as POCIs and 19 (25\%) as lacunar infarcts. Mean CCA-IMT was higher
in patients (1.03+/-0.18 mm) than in controls (0.85+/-0.18 mm; P<0.0001).
The history of cerebrovascular disease was much lower in the patients
with POCI and TACI, and the prevalence of ischemic cardiac disease
was in the range of 20\% in patients with TACIs to more than 40\%
in patients with PACIs. CONCLUSIONS: An increased CCA-IMT as a marker
of general atherosclerosis was associated with IBI and reflects cardiovascular
risk. Carotid and coronary atherosclerosis were positively correlated
with IBIs, with significant differences across the subtypes.},

abstract = {Atherosclerotic plaques with high likelihood of rupture often show local temperature increase with respect to the surrounding arterial wall temperature. In this work, atherosclerotic plaque temperature was numerically determined during the different levels of blood flow reduction produced by the introduction of catheters at the vessel lumen. The temperature was calculated by solving the energy equation and the Navier-Stokes equations in 2D idealized arterial models. Arterial wall temperature depends on three basic factors: metabolic activity of the inflammatory cells embedded in the plaque, heat convection due to luminal blood flow, and heat conduction through the arterial wall and plaque. The calculations performed serve to simulate transient blood flow reduction produced by the presence of thermography catheters used to measure arterial wall temperature. The calculations estimate the spatial and temporal alterations in the cooling effect of blood flow and plaque temperature during the measurement process. The mathematical model developed provides a tool for analyzing the contribution of factors known to affect heat transfer at the plaque surface. Blood flow reduction leads to a nonuniform temperature increase ranging from 0.1 to 0.25 degrees Celsius in the plaque/lumen interface of the arterial geometries considered in this study. The temperature variation as well as the Nusselt number calculated along the plaque surface strongly depended on the arterial geometry and distribution of inflammatory cells. The calculations indicate that the minimum required time to obtain a steady temperature profile after arterial occlusion is 6 s. It was seen that in arteries with geometries involving bends, the temperature profiles appear asymmetrical and lean toward the downstream edge of the plaque.},

However, misalignment of the US catheter in the vessel lumen can cause incorrect strain estimation in intravascular US elastography caused by strain projection artifacts. In this paper, we present a general theoretical solution where the impact of catheter eccentricity, tilt and noncoplanar errors on the strain estimates are derived. Appropriate corrections to strain estimates can then be applied with prior knowledge of the catheter position information to reduce the strain projection artifacts. Simulations using a frequency-domain-based algorithm that models intravascular US imaging before and after a specified deformation are presented. The simulations are used to verify the theoretical derivations for two displacement situations (linear and nonlinear) under intraluminal pressure, with and without stress decay. The linear displacement case demonstrates that the correction factor is dependent only on the angle between the US beam and the cross-sectional plane of the vessel. For the nonlinear displacement case, where a l/r stress decay in the displacement is modeled, the correction factor becomes a more complicated function of the azimuthal angle.},

and Neuropsychiatric Inventory [NPI]) and assessment of activities
of daily living (Interview for Deterioration in Daily Living Activities
in Dementia [IDDD]) were performed initially and 6 months later.
SCE positive (SCE+ve, n = 47) and SCE negative (SCE-ve, n = 85) patients
were compared using repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs)
adjusted for age, gender, and cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS:
SCE+ve patients with dementia, both AD and VaD, suffered a more rapid
decline in cognitive functioning over 6 months (ADAS-cog, mean increase
7.1 for SCE+ve compared with 3.3 for SCE-ve, p = .006) and activities
of daily living (IDDD, mean increase 24.4 for SCE+ve compared with
10.8 for SCE-ve, p = .014). CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic SCE are associated
with an accelerated cognitive and functional decline in dementia.
SCE may be a potentially treatable cause of disease progression in
dementia.},

of white matter ischaemia (WMI) have been shown to be independent
predictors of stroke risk. This study tests the hypothesis that there
is an association between carotid plaque morphology as determined
by high-resolution carotid MRI and WMI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty
patients (80 arteries) with at least 40\% stenosis on screening Doppler
ultrasound were recruited and underwent high-resolution axial carotid
MRI at 1.5 T. In a blinded manner, plaque characteristics such as
lipid core, fibrous cap, intraplaque haemorrhage, lumen area, plaque
area, and American Heart Association (AHA) classification were qualitatively
and quantitatively evaluated. The severity of WMI was independently
quantified using a modified Scheltens score based on standard brain
Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery. Linear mixed effect models were
used to test if carotid plaque characteristics could independently
predict severity of WMI. RESULTS: Hypertension (p=0.005) and previous
a history of transient ischaemic attack or stroke (p=0.038) were
found to be significant predictors of severity of WMI. After accounting
for confounding variables, no significant association was found between
the modified Scheltens score and lipid core size (p=0.122), fibrous

abstract = {Atheromatous carotid plaque rupture is responsible for the majority of ischaemic strokes in the developed world. Plaque rupture has been associated with plaque morphology, plaque components' properties, inflammation and local stress concentration. High resolution multi-spectral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has allowed the plaque components to be visualized in vivo. This study combined the recent advances in finite element analysis (FEA) and MRI, and performed stress analysis of five vulnerable carotid plaques based on the geometry derived from in vivo MRI. Image segmentation was based on multi-spectral MRI and co-registered with histology for plaque characterization. Plaque fibrous cap, lipid pool and vessel wall were modelled as isotropic, incompressible hyperelastic materials undergoing large deformation under pulse pressure loading. High stress concentrations were predicted at the shoulders and the thinnest fibrous cap regions of the plaque, and the mean maximal stresses were found to be higher in the ruptured plaques (683.3 kPa) than those in the unruptured plaques (226.9 kPa). The effect of the relative stiffness of fibrous cap to lipid pool on the stress within the cap itself was studied. It was shown that larger relative stiffness of fibrous cap to lipid pool resulted in higher stress within the cap. Thus, it is likely that high stress concentrations in vulnerable plaque may cause plaque rupture and lead to acute ischaemic sequelae. A combination of in vivo high resolution MRI and FEA could potentially act as a useful tool to assess plaque vulnerability and risk stratify patients with carotid atheroma.},

60 patients underwent multi-contrast imaging of their internal carotid
arteries. Different plaque components were manually delineated on
acquired axial images to assess the difference in prevalence of plaque
hemorrhage, fibrous cap (FC) rupture and FC thickness among the three
groups. RESULTS: 55\% acute symptomatic patients had plaque hemorrhage
vs. 35\% for recently symptomatic group and 5\% for asymptomatic
group (p-value: group 1 vs. 3: 0.001, group 2 vs. 3: 0.04). Type
1 hemorrhage was more common in acute symptomatic patients than recently
symptomatic patients (40\% vs. 5\%, p=0.01). Type 2 hemorrhage was
more common in recently symptomatic vs. acute symptomatic patients
(15\% vs. 30\%). FC rupture was observed in 50\% of patients in group
1 vs. 35\% of group 2 patients (p=0.02) but none in group 3. The
mean minimum FC thickness was same in acute and recently symptomatic

Magnetic resonance imaging was employed to test the usability of
the harvested arteries. Histological analyses has served to characterize
the different tissue types. Prepared strips of 7 different tissue
types underwent cyclic quasistatic uniaxial tension tests in axial
and circumferential directions; ultimate tensile stresses and stretches
were documented. Experimental data of individual samples indicated
anisotropic and highly nonlinear tissue properties as well as considerable
interspecimen differences. The calcification showed, however, a linear
property, with about the same stiffness as observed for the adventitia
in high stress regions. The stress and stretch values at calcification
fracture are smaller (179+/-56 kf'a and 1.02+/-0.005) than for each

the lowest fracture stress occurred in the circumferential direction

respectively, p = 0.005). In the whole series of 52 lesions, echolucent
plaques showed a higher degree of contrast-agent enhancement (p <
0.001). Stenosis degree was not associated with neovascularization
at histology or with the grade of contrast-agent enhancement. CONCLUSIONS:
Carotid plaque contrast-agent enhancement with sonographic agents
correlates with histological density of neovessels and is associated
with plaque echolucency, a well-accepted marker of high risk lesions,
but it is unrelated to the degree of stenosis. Contrast-enhanced
carotid ultrasound imaging may provide valuable information for plaque
risk stratification and for assessing the response to antiatherosclerotic
therapies, beyond that provided by standard ultrasound imaging.},

abstract = {Although during the last decade there have been great advances in
our knowledge of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of multi-district
atherosclerotic disease, little is known about the association between
peripheral arterial disease and carotid artery disease. This review
was conceived to cast some light on this topic, paying special attention
to inflammation which plays a pivotal role in atherosclerosis. An
aspect of pathophysiologic and clinical relevance is that the coexistence
of carotid disease is more frequent in peripheral arterial disease
than in coronary artery disease, not only in terms of carotid stenosis,
but also with respect to the presence of hypoechoic unstable plaque.
These latter plaques present a large infiltration of macrophages
and are associated to high levels of inflammatory markers. In particular,
the greater prevalence of hypoechoic carotid plaques in peripheral
arterial disease compared to patients with carotid artery disease
was poorly related to classic risk factors, but showed an independent
association with an increased number of leukocyte and neutrophil
cells, which are reliable markers of inflammation. The greater prevalence
of hypoechoic unstable carotid plaques could explain why peripheral
arterial disease portends higher risk of stroke than coronary artery
disease.},

@article{Urbani1993,
abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The ultrasonic image can offer unique information
on the composition of atherosclerotic plaque, ie, the relative content
of lipids, fibrous tissue, and calcific deposits. To date, however,
the echographic assessment of plaque structure is based on a subjective,
qualitative evaluation of the bidimensional images. We evaluated
the feasibility and accuracy of assessing, in vivo, the acoustic
properties of arterial carotid plaques by means of a suitably modified
echographic apparatus allowing direct access to the radiofrequency
signal. METHODS: In 15 patients undergoing carotid thromboendarterectomy,
the ultrasonic findings in 70 discrete sites (within the plaque,
n = 54; normal sites, n = 11; or intraluminal thrombi, n = 5) were
correlated with the histological analysis (hematoxylin-eosin and
Mallory trichrome stains) independently performed on the arterial
samples. The pathological examination was carried out at a similar
level of the insonation; the sites analyzed within the plaque were
chosen because of their uniform echoic characteristics. In each ultrasonic
region of interest selected from the echographic image, the integrated
amplitude of the rectified radiofrequency signal was measured as
the integrated backscatter index. RESULTS: The intimal-medial layer
of normal carotid wall (n = 11) exhibited values of -32.5 +/- 9.4
dB. The integrated backscatter index in fatty sites (n = 11, -40.3
+/- 5.4 dB) differed from that of fibrous (n = 12, -23.8 +/- 5.0
dB) and calcified (n = 26, -11.5 +/- 5.2 dB, P < .01 for all intergroup
differences) sites. Intraluminal thrombotic sites (n = 5, -42 +/-
5.1 dB, P < .01) differed from fibrous and calcified subsets (P <
.01) but overlapped (P = NS) with fatty sites. Histological sampling
also showed two sites of intraplaque hemorrhage that exhibited very
low backscatter values (-53 and -58 dB) and three fibrofatty sites
showing backscatter values (-28, -28, and -32 dB) intermediate between
the fibrous and the fatty subsets. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative analysis
of integrated backscatter of the arterial wall is feasible in humans
and provides an operator-independent assessment of plaque echoic
structure. In particular, integrated backscatter is effective in
distinguishing lipidic, fibrotic, and calcific components in human
atherosclerotic plaques.},

abstract = {Shear stress of the blood at the vessel wall plays an important role
in many processes in the cardiovascular system primarily focused
on the regulation of vessel lumen and wall dimensions. There is ample
evidence that atherosclerotic plaques are generated at low shear
stress regions in the cardiovascular system, while high shear stress
regions are protected. In the course of plaque progression, advanced
plaques start to encroach into the lumen, and thereby start to experience
high shear stress at the endothelium. Until now the consequences
of high shear stress working at the endothelium of an advanced plaque
are unknown. As high shear stress influences tissue regression, we
hypothesised that high shear stress can destabilise the plaque by
cap weakening leading to ulceration. We investigated this hypothesis
in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset of a 67-year-old woman
with a plaque in the carotid artery at baseline and an ulcer at ten-month
follow-up. The lumen, plaque components (lipid/necrotic core, intraplaque
haemorrhage) and ulcer were reconstructed three dimensionally and
the geometry at baseline was used for shear stress calculation using
computational fluid dynamics. Correlation of the change in plaque
composition with the shear stress at baseline showed that the ulcer
was generated exclusively at the high shear stress location. In this
serial MRI study we found plaque ulceration at the high shear stress
location of a protruding plaque in the carotid artery. Our data suggest
that high shear stress influences plaque vulnerability and therefore
may become a potential parameter for predicting future events. (Neth

Analysis was performed on 82 regions-of-interest (ROIs). The IBS
values for collagen, lipid and hemorrhage plaques were 5.8 +/- 5.4,

the slope and intercept parameter images were noisy. Mean IBS, midband,

different (p < 0.05) from lipid, hemorrhage and fibrolipid plaques.
The bias and limits of agreement (1.3 +/- 4.9 dB) between the grey-scale

interchangeable. Results indicate necessary improvements, such as
reduction of large measurement variances and identification of robust

abstract = {Our objective was to evaluate the association of arterial (18)F-FDG
uptake and calcifications in large arteries as detected by (18)F-FDG
PET/CT with the subsequent occurrence of vascular events in otherwise
asymptomatic cancer patients. METHODS: Clinical follow-up information
was obtained for 932 cancer patients examined with whole-body (18)F-FDG
PET/CT (median follow-up time, 29 mo). Among this cohort, 279 patients
had died from their oncologic disease. In 15 of 932 patients (1.6\%),
a vascular event, defined as ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction,
or revascularization, was registered. The maximal standardized uptake
value (SUV) was divided by the blood-pool SUV, yielding a target-to-background
ratio (TBR) for each arterial segment. The mean TBR as well as a
calcified plaque sum score per patient were calculated in the major
vessels: ascending, descending, and abdominal aorta, aortic arch,
as well as iliac and carotid arteries. RESULTS: A significant correlation
was observed between mean TBR and calcified plaque sum (P < 0.001).
Although calcified plaque sum significantly correlated with all conventional
risk factors for vascular events, mean TBR correlated only with age,
the male sex, and hypertension. The Cox regression hazard model identified
a mean TBR >/= 1.7 and a calcified plaque sum >/= 15 as independent
predictors for the occurrence of a vascular event. Patients with
both mean TBR and calcified plaque sum above these thresholds were
identified as having the highest risk for a future vascular event.
However, a mean TBR >/= 1.7 had greater prognostic value than did
a calcified plaque sum >/= 15. CONCLUSION: In a large cohort of cancer
patients, increased (18)F-FDG uptake in major arteries emerged as
the strongest predictor of a subsequent vascular event. Concomitant
severe vascular calcifications seemed to impart a particularly high
risk. Given the small event rate in the present study, larger, prospective
trials of patients without cancer are required to substantiate these
promising results.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rupture of vulnerable atheromatous plaque in the carotid
and coronary arteries often leads to stroke and heart attack respectively.
The role of calcium deposition and its contribution to plaque stability
is controversial. This study uses both an idealized and a patient-specific
model to evaluate the effect of a calcium deposit on the stress distribution
within an atheromatous plaque. METHODS: Using a finite-element method,
structural analysis was performed on an idealized plaque model and
the location of a calcium deposit within it was varied. In addition
to the idealized model, in vivo high-resolution MR imaging was performed
on 3 patients with carotid atheroma and stress distributions were
generated. The individual plaques were chosen as they had calcium
at varying locations with respect to the lumen and the fibrous cap.
RESULTS: The predicted maximum stress was increased by 47.5\% when
the calcium deposit was located in the thin fibrous cap in the model
when compared with that in a model without a deposit. The result
of adding a calcium deposit either to the lipid core or remote from
the lumen resulted in almost no increase in maximal stress. CONCLUSION:
Calcification at the thin fibrous cap may result in high stress concentrations,
ultimately increasing the risk of plaque rupture. Assessing the location
of calcification may, in the future, aid in the risk stratification
of patients with carotid stenosis.},

scanning to follow-up (1) the contralateral artery in 289 patients
who had undergone carotid endarterectomy, with a mean follow-up 22
months and a range of 0 to 48 months and (2) the carotid arteries
in 130 patients who had no surgical treatment and had been symptom
free, with a mean follow-up period of 15 months and a range of 0
to 48 months. Plaques were graded as to the ratio of echolucency
to echogenicity, with type 1 being most echolucent and type 4 being
most echogenic. A normal-appearing artery was classified as type
5. Heterogeneous plaques (types 1 and 2) occurred significantly more
(p less than 0.001) in symptomatic preoperative arteries than in
asympatomatic arteries. Follow-up of the asymptomatic vessels showed
that the majority of plaques either remained the same or became more
echogenic (fibrous). Approximately one fourth of plaques in each
group degenerated (more echolucent). Thirty-one patients (10.7\%)
developed new symptoms in the contralateral asymptomatic group, with
10 patients (3.5\%) having strokes. Fourteen of 130 (10.8\%) patients,
or 5.4\% of vessel territories at risk, in the primary asymptomatic
group developed new symptoms, with only two strokes occurring. In
the contralateral asymptomatic group those patients who initially
had greater than 75\% stenoses fared worse than those with primary
asymptomatic disease with greater than 75\% stenosis. Although the
overall development of new symptoms is low in both populations, our
data indicate that those patients with heterogeneous plaques or whose
plaques have undergone change may be at risk for new symptoms. Longer
follow-up studies are needed to define the role of plaque changes
in the development of symptoms. For now we advocate a conservative
"wait and see" approach to symptom-free patients with greater than
75\% stenoses and calcified plaques. We suggest a more aggressive
approach, recommending early surgical intervention, to those few

abstract = {To find out the types of atherosclerotic plaques that fissure and
where they fissure, plaques from 85 patients who had died from coronary
thrombosis were examined histologically. 67 of the plaques contained
an eccentric pool of extracellular lipid in the intima; 42 (63\%)
of these plaques had fissured at the junction of the plaque cap with
the more normal intima, and the other 25 (37\%) had torn through
the centre of the cap. Computer modelling of different forms of plaque
showed that at systole eccentric pools of lipid concentrated stress
on the plaque cap, especially near the edge of the plaque. When the
lipid pool occupied less than 15\% of the vessel circumference, and
when the plaque cap was less stiff than the adjacent normal intima,
the point of maximum stress was over the centre of the plaque. Computer
modelling also showed that the distribution of circumferential tensile
stress across the intima was radically altered by atherosclerotic
plaques. Regions of high circumferential stress correlated well with
the site of intimal tears found at necropsy. The histological findings
showed that site of tearing was influenced by variation in the mechanical
strength of cap tissue due to focal accumulation of foam cells. Focal
weak points in the cap would explain tears which were not at the
point of maximum stress.},

technique to characterize atherosclerotic plaque. Methods-In 9 subjects
(7 men, 2 women; mean age 33 years), known anatomic areas (carotid,
fat, muscle, iliotibial tract, and tibia) were scanned with an Acuson
duplex ultrasound machine with 72 machine settings. The ultrasound
images of these anatomic areas were recorded on magneto-optical disks.
Echo amplitude statistics were obtained, and the mean pixel value
(MPV) was used to assess the level of echogenicity. The ideal settings
of this particular scanner for optimal discrimination between these
tissues types were identified by the Heuristic Index of Discrimination.
With these settings, carotid artery scanning was performed on 17
patients (15 men, 2 women; mean age 65 years), and the image analysis
of their ultrasound carotid plaques was compared with their histological
findings. Results-In this study, discrimination between the selected
tissues was found to be optimal when the controls were set at log
40 dB, 0/2/0, and gain of -5 dB. The MPV of the carotid specimens
scanned at this setting correlated significantly with the histological
findings (Spearman correlation, P=0.002). Conclusions-Computer-assisted
image analysis to give the MPV is a technique that may be used to
identify unstable atherosclerotic plaques reliably.},

abstract = {Thermal strain imaging (TSI) using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has the potential to identify lipid pools within rupture-prone arterial plaques and serve as a valuable supplement to current IVUS systems in diagnosing acute coronary syndromes. The major challenge for in vivo application of TSI will be cardiac motion, including bulk motion and tissue deformation. Simulations based on an artery model, including a lipid-filled plaque, demonstrate that effective bulk motion compensation can be achieved within a certain motion range using spatial interpolation. We also propose a practical imaging scheme to minimize mechanical strains caused by tissue deformation based on a linear least squares fitting strategy. This scheme was tested on clinical data by artificially superimposing thermal displacements corresponding to different temperature rises. Results suggest a 1-2 degrees C temperature rise is required to detect lipids in an atherosclerotic plaque in vivo.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that vascular risk factors (VRF)
contribute to cognitive decline. Whether their treatment can slow
down the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD) remains unsettled.
The aim of this observational study was to evaluate whether the treatment
of VRF is associated with a slower cognitive decline in patients
who have AD without cerebrovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: We recruited
301 consecutive patients who had AD without CVD (mean age 71.7 years;
69.4\% women; first Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] mean score
21.6; mean follow-up 2.3 years), who had attended a memory clinic
between 1997 and 2003. VRF sought were high blood pressure, dyslipidemia,
diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, and atherosclerotic disease.
Only 21 patients (7.0\%) had no VRF. Others were classified as having
no VRF treated (n = 72; 25.7\%), some VRF treated (n = 119; 42.5\%),
or all VRF treated (n = 89; 31.8\%). We compared MMSE progression
over time among these 3 groups using a mixed random effects regression
model. RESULTS: Baseline MMSE scores were similar in the 3 groups.
With adjustment for confounding factors, MMSE progression over time
differed significantly between groups (p = 0.002). Patients with
all their VRF treated declined less than those with none of their
VRF treated. Those with some VRF treated tended to have an intermediate
decline. CONCLUSIONS: In patients who have Alzheimer disease without
CVD, treatment of vascular risk factors (VRF) is associated with
a slower decline in Mini-Mental State Examination score. Randomized
controlled trials are needed to confirm this association, but our
data suggest that dementia should not prevent treatment of VRF.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: In carotid artery disease, correlation of carotid plaque
morphology with the patient's presenting symptoms has drawn conflicting
conclusions. The purpose of this series was to correlate carotid
plaque characteristics with the presenting symptoms from a large
cohort of patients who underwent operation for carotid artery disease.
METHODS: From a series of 1252 consecutive patients who underwent
carotid endarterectomy, presenting symptoms were divided into three
groups: transiently symptomatic (transient ischemic attack [TIA]
or amaurosis fugax), prior stroke, and asymptomatic. Plaque characteristics,
including ulceration, intraplaque hemorrhage, and degree of stenosis,
were recorded prospectively for 1008 procedures. All endarterectomy
specimens were inspected during the procedure, and plaque characteristics
were recorded immediately after operation. RESULTS: There was a higher
incidence of plaque ulceration in the transiently symptomatic and
prior stroke groups (391 of 508 [77\%] and 91 of 115 [79\%]) than
in the asymptomatic cohort (231 of 385 [60\%]; p < 0.0001, chi2 test).
There was no significant difference in the incidence of plaque hemorrhage
between the transiently symptomatic and prior stroke patients compared
with the asymptomatic patients. There was no statistical difference
for ulcerated plaque or plaque hemorrhage between the transiently
symptomatic and prior stroke group. Intraplaque hemorrhage occurred
more frequently in patients with high-grade stenosis (90\% to 99\%)
than in those with less than 90\% stenosis (202 of 299 [68\%] versus
97 of 299 [32\%]; p = 0.01, chi2 test). CONCLUSIONS: On gross examination
of the carotid specimen in the operating room, plaque ulceration
correlates with an initial presentation of amaurosis fugax, TIA,
or prior stroke compared with patients operated on for asymptomatic
disease. The presence of intraplaque hemorrhage is associated with
more advanced stenosis of the internal carotid artery. These findings
suggest that plaque morphology does play an important role in the
presentation of carotid artery disease.},

abstract = {Retrospective studies have shown improvement in migraines after patent
foramen ovale (PFO) closure. To date, no study has evaluated whether
the completeness of closure affects headache status; therefore, the
objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of residual right-to-left
shunt (RLS) on migraine symptoms after transcatheter PFO closure
in migraineurs with and without aura. This was a small-series, single-center,
retrospective analysis of late follow-up data on 77 patients with
presumed paradoxical embolism and migraine who underwent PFO closure
for secondary stroke prevention. Power M-mode transcranial Doppler
was used to assess RLS at baseline and 6 and 12 months after closure.
A standardized migraine questionnaire was administered at baseline
and 6, 12, and 24 months after closure. Fifty-five (71\%) patients
had migraine with aura. Final closure and migraine status were available
for 67 patients; 23 (34\%) had incomplete PFO closure, defined as
30 embolic tracks detected at final power M-mode transcranial Doppler
examination (median 366 days, 95\% confidence interval 332 to 474).
Migraine relief (> or = 50\% reduction in frequency) was independent
of closure status (77\% complete closure vs 83\% incomplete closure,
p = 0.76) at late follow-up (540 days, 95\% confidence interval 537
to 711). Migraineurs with aura were 4.5 times more likely to experience
migraine relief than migraineurs without aura. In conclusion, migraine
relief may occur despite residual RLS after transcatheter PFO closure,
which may suggest a reduction in RLS burden below a neuronal threshold
that triggers migraine; however, this warrants further investigation.
Migraine with aura may be an independent predictor of relief after
PFO closure.},

abstract = {Mapping the local elastic properties of an atherosclerotic artery is of major interest for predicting the disease evolution or an intervention outcome. These properties can be investigated by elastography, which estimates the strain distribution within a medium in response to a stress. But because diseased arteries are highly heterogeneous, a small global deformation may result in high local strains in the softest regions. For those reasons, we use in this paper the strain estimation method we recently developed to compute elastograms of original vessel-mimicking cryogel phantoms and a fresh excised human carotid artery. This adaptive method has been effectively proved to be accurate in a wider range of strains (0-7\%) than commonly used gradient-based methods, and very adapted for investigating highly heterogeneous tissues. Resulting elastograms cover a wider range of strains (0-3.5\%) than all previously reported intravascular elastograms, improving the discrimination between healthy and diseased regions.

abstract = {The goal of this study was to model the in vivo non-linear mechanical behavior of human common carotid arteries (CCAs) and then to compare wall stresses and associated contributions of micro-constituents in normotensive (NT) and treated hypertensive (HT) subjects. We used an established theoretical model of 3D arterial mechanics that assumes a hyperelastic, anisotropic, active-passive, and residually stressed wall. In vivo data were obtained non-invasively from CCAs in 16 NT (21-64\&nbsp;years old) and 25 treated HT (44-69\&nbsp;years old) subjects. The associated quasi-static boundary value problem was solved semi-analytically over a cardiac cycle while accounting for surrounding perivascular tissue. Best-fit values of model parameters, including those describing contributions by intramural elastin, fibrillar collagen, and vascular smooth muscle, were estimated by a non-linear least-squares method. The model (1) captured temporal changes in intraluminal pressure, (2) estimated wall stress fields that appeared to reflect the presence or absence of age and disease, and (3) suggested changes in mechanical characteristics of wall micro-constituents despite medical treatment of hypertension. For example, age was positively correlated with residual stresses and altered fibrillar collagen in NT subjects, which indirectly validated the modeling, and HT subjects had higher levels of stresses, increased smooth muscle tone, and a stiffer elastin-dominated matrix despite treatment. These results are consistent with prior reports on effects of age and hypertension, but provide increased insight into evolving contributions of cell and matrix mechanics to arterial behavior in vivo. \&copy; 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

among young individuals with stroke as well as dysfunction of cerebral
arteries during migraine attacks prompt speculation on the existence
of a comorbidity between the two disorders. The recent finding of
silent infarct-like brain lesions in migraineurs reinforced this
hypothesis and raised questions on whether migraine may be a progressive
disorder rather than simply an episodic disorder. Stroke can occur
during the course of migraine attacks with aura, supporting the assumption
of a causal relation between the two diseases. Migraine may accentuate
other existing risk factors for stroke, and both jointly increase
the risk of cerebral ischemia outside of migraine attacks. In this
regard, the role of migraine might be that of predisposing condition
for cerebral ischemia. Migraine and ischemic stroke may be the end
phenotype of common pathogenic mechanisms. Evidence of a migraine-stroke
relation in cases of specific disorders, such as CADASIL (cerebral
autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy)
and MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis,
and stroke-like episodes), strongly supports this concept. Finally,
acute focal cerebral ischemia can trigger migraine attacks, and,
thus, migraine may be the consequence of stroke. In this paper, we
will review contemporary epidemiologic studies, discuss potential
mechanisms of migraine-induced stroke and comorbid ischemic stroke,
and pose new research questions.},

considers the speckle as a material property; this assumption then
led to the derivation of the optical flow equations. which were suitably
combined with the Lagrangian speckle model estimator to provide the
full 2-D polar strain tensor. In this study, the proposed algorithm
was validated in vitro using a fresh excised human carotid artery.
The experimental setup consisted of a cardiovascular imaging system
(CVIS) US scanner. working with a 30-NHz mechanical rotating single-element
transducer, a digital oscilloscope and a pressuring system. A sequence
of radiofrequency (RF) images was collected while incrementally adjusting
the intraluminal static pressure steps. The results showed the potential
of this 2-D algorithm to characterize and to distinguish an atherosclerotic
plaque from the normal vascular tissue. Namely, the geometry as well
as some mechanical characteristics of the detected plaque were in
good agreement with histology. The results also suggested that there
might exist a range of intraluminal pressures for which plaque detectability
is optimal. (C) 2005 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine

abstract = {Background: The correlation of B-mode ultrasonographic morphology
with histologic characteristics of atherosclerotic carotid plaques
remains ill-defined. The classification of plaques with recently
reported measures of plaque echogenicity and heterogeneity has been
unsatisfactory. We used computer-assisted duplex ultrasound (DU)
scan image analysis to determine echogenicity of specific tissues
in control subjects. This information was used to quantify each tissue
in imaged carotid plaques with pixel distribution analysis (PDA).
These objective observations then were quantitatively compared with
plaque histology in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Methods:
We performed standardized DU scanning of healthy tissues in 10 volunteer
subjects and of 20 carotid artery plaques (7 symptomatic and 13 asymptomatic)
in 19 patients with carotid stenosis. The plaques underwent histologic
analysis after carotid endarterectomy. The grayscale intensity ranges
of blood, lipid, fibromuscular tissue, and calcium were calculated
in the control subjects. With computer-assisted image analysis, B-mode
images of plaques were linearly scaled to normalize data. Pixel distribution
within the images then was analyzed. The grayscale ranges of known
tissues obtained from control subjects helped define the amount of
intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid, fibromuscular tissue, and calcium
within carotid plaque images. This analysis was correlated with tissue
composition measurements on histologic sections of excised plaques.
Results: The median grayscale intensity (range) in control subjects
was 2 (0 to 4) for blood, 12 (8 to 26) for lipid, 53 (41 to 76) for
muscle, 172 (112 to 196) for fibrous tissue, and 221 (211 to 255)
for calcium. PDA-derived predictions for blood, lipid, fibromuscular
tissue, and calcium within carotid plaques correlated significantly
with the histologic estimates of each tissue respectively (blood:
P=.012; lipid: P=.0006; fibromuscular: P=.035; and calcium: P=.0001).
A significantly higher amount of blood and lipid was seen within
symptomatic plaques compared with asymptomatic ones (P=.0048 and
P=.026, respectively). Conversely, a larger amount of calcification
was noted within asymptomatic plaques (P=.0002): Conclusion: Computer-assisted
PDA of DU scan images accurately quantified intraplaque hemorrhage,
fibromuscular tissue, calcium, and lipid. Symptomatic plaques had
lower calcium content but larger amounts of intraplaque hemorrhage
and lipid. Quantitative PDA may be used to determine carotid plaque
tissue composition to assist in the identification of symptomatic
and potentially unstable asymptomatic plaques.},

abstract = {Stroke and myocardial infarction are initiated by rupturing vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques. With noninvasive ultrasound elastography, these plaques might be detected in carotid arteries. However, since the ultrasound beam is generally not aligned with the radial direction in which the artery pulsates, radial and circumferential strains need to be derived from axial and lateral data. Conventional techniques to perform this conversion have the disadvantage that lateral strain is required. Since the lateral strain has relatively poor accuracy, the quality of the radial and circumferential strains is reduced. In this study, the radial and circumferential strain estimates are improved by combining axial strain data acquired at multiple insonification angles. Adaptive techniques to correct for grating lobe interference and other artifacts that occur when performing beam steering at large angles are introduced. Acquisitions at multiple angles are performed with a beam steered linear array. For each beam steered angle, there are two spatially restricted regions of the circular vessel cross section where the axial strain is closely aligned with the radial strain and two spatially restricted regions (different from the radial strain regions) where the axial strain is closely aligned with the circumferential strain. These segments with high quality strain estimates are compounded to form radial or circumferential strain images. Compound radial and circumferential strain images were constructed for a homogeneous vessel phantom with a concentric lumen subjected to different intraluminal pressures. Comparison of the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR(e)) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR(e)) revealed that compounding increases the image quality considerably compared to images from 0 degrees information only. SNR(e) and CNR(e) increase up to 2.7 and 6.6 dB, respectively. The highest image quality was achieved by projecting axial data, completed with a small segment determined by either principal component analysis or by application of a rotation matrix.},

abstract = {Attenuation estimation methods for medical ultrasound are important
because attenuation properties of soft tissue can be used to distinguish
between benign and malignant tumors and to detect diffuse disease.
The classical spectral shift method and the spectral difference method
are the most commonly used methods for the estimation of the attenuation;
however, they both have specific limitations. Classical spectral
shift approaches for estimating ultrasonic attenuation are more sensitive
to local spectral noise artifacts and have difficulty in compensating
for diffraction effects because of beam focusing. Spectral difference
approaches, on the other hand, fail to accurately estimate attenuation
coefficient values at tissue boundaries that also possess variations
in the backscatter. In this paper, we propose a hybrid attenuation
estimation method that combines the advantages of the spectral difference
and spectral shift methods to overcome their specific limitations.
The proposed hybrid method initially uses the spectral difference
approach to reduce the impact of system-dependent parameters including
diffraction effects. The normalized power spectrum that includes
variations because of backscatter changes is then filtered using
a Gaussian filter centered at the transmit center frequency of the
system. A spectral shift method, namely the spectral cross-correlation
algorithm is then used to compute spectral shifts from these filtered
power spectra to estimate the attenuation coefficient. Ultrasound
simulation results demonstrate that the estimation accuracy of the
hybrid method is better than the centroid downshift method (spectral
shift method), in uniformly attenuating regions. In addition, this
method is also stable at boundaries with variations in the backscatter
when compared with the reference phantom method (spectral difference
method). Experimental results using tissue-mimicking phantom also
illustrate that the hybrid method is more robust and provides accurate
attenuation estimates in both uniformly attenuating regions and across
boundaries with backscatter variations. The proposed hybrid method
preserves the advantages of both the spectral shift and spectral
difference approaches while eliminating the disadvantages associated
with each of these methods, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness
of the attenuation estimation.},

is therefore of particular importance. On the basis of large clinical
trials, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is performed in selected patient
groups to prevent stroke. Patient symptomatology and degree of carotid
stenosis are the main clinical grounds to perform CEA. However, many
individual patients undergo surgery with its attendant risks without
taking advantage of it, whereas in others CEA is probably incorrectly
withheld. There is therefore an urgent need for new adjuncts to identify
high-risk subgroups of patients who particularly benefit from potentially
hazardous interventions. Multiple noninvasive imaging modalities
have shown their potential to differentiate high-risk, vulnerable
carotid plaques from stable plaques. The ultimate goal is to implement
one or a combination of these imaging modalities in daily clinical
practice. This review gives an up-to-date overview of the clinical
potential of these imaging modalities in identifying patients with
carotid atherosclerosis who are at high risk for developing stroke.
Advantages and limitations of each imaging technique are outlined.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE--To determine whether the addition of carotid endarterectomy
to aggressive medical management can reduce the incidence of cerebral
infarction in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.
DESIGN--Prospective, randomized, multicenter trial. SETTING--Thirty-nine
clinical sites across the United States and Canada. PATIENTS--Between
December 1987 and December 1993, a total of 1662 patients with asymptomatic
carotid artery stenosis of 60\% or greater reduction in diameter
were randomized; follow-up data are available on 1659. At baseline,
recognized risk factors for stroke were similar between the two treatment
groups. INTERVENTION--Daily aspirin administration and medical risk
factor management for all patients; carotid endarterectomy for patients
randomized to receive surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Initially,
transient ischemic attack or cerebral infarction occurring in the
distribution of the study artery and any transient ischemic attack,
stroke, or death occurring in the perioperative period. In March
1993, the primary outcome measures were changed to cerebral infarction
occurring in the distribution of the study artery or any stroke or
death occurring in the perioperative period. RESULTS--After a median
follow-up of 2.7 years, with 4657 patient-years of observation, the
aggregate risk over 5 years for ipsilateral stroke and any perioperative
stroke or death was estimated to be 5.1\% for surgical patients and
11.0\% for patients treated medically (aggregate risk reduction of
53\% [95\% confidence interval, 22\% to 72\%]). CONCLUSION--Patients
with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis of 60\% or greater reduction
in diameter and whose general health makes them good candidates for
elective surgery will have a reduced 5-year risk of ipsilateral stroke
if carotid endarterectomy performed with less than 3\% perioperative
morbidity and mortality is added to aggressive management of modifiable
risk factors.},

can be used to determine carotid plaque composition and that specific
plaque characteristics are associated with a worse clinical outcome.
However, histological studies examining the relationship between
carotid plaque morphology and clinical outcome have reported conflicting
findings. Furthermore, few investigators have described plaque morphology
in quantifiable terms. This study examines the association between
the volume of carotid plaque constituents and preoperative ischemic
neurological symptoms. Constituents examined were chosen based on
their potential for identification by current diagnostic imaging
modalities such as ultrasound or MRI. METHODS: Atherosclerotic plaques
from 43 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were examined
histologically, with sections obtained every 0.5 to 1 mm. The lesions
were examined for the presence and quantity of fibrous intimal tissue,
intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid core, necrotic plaque core, and calcification.
The quantity of each constituent was compared in plaques removed
from symptomatic patients with those excised from asymptomatic individuals.
Differences were analyzed with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. RESULTS:
There was no difference between plaques removed from asymptomatic
and symptomatic patients with regard to the presence and volume of
fibrous intimal tissue, intraplaque hemorrhage, the lipid core, the
necrotic core, or calcification. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with highly
stenotic carotid lesions who are undergoing carotid endarterectomy,
gross plaque composition is similar regardless of preoperative symptom
status. Given this similarity, it is unlikely that differences in
the volume of intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid core, necrotic core,
or calcification in atherosclerotic carotid plaques explain their
embolic history.},

coronary artery specimens pressure-fixed by formalin. Radiofrequency
signals were sampled with a 30-MHz IVUS catheter and digitized at
500 MHz in 8-bit resolution. The ROIs were histologically categorized
into 12 plaques with a lipid core and 12 plaques without it. Integrated
backscatter and statistical parameters of the radiofrequency envelope
(mean/SD ratio [MSR], skewness, and kurtosis) within the ROI were
calculated offline, and their ability to detect a lipid core was
compared with visual analysis of the IVUS video images. In the group
with lipid cores, percent area of a lipid core in each ROI was measured
in a digitized histologic image by a computerized planimeter. RESULTS:
Sensitivity and specificity of MSR, skewness, and kurtosis for lipid
core detection were substantially greater than visual video image
analysis (83.3\% and 91.7\%, 100\% and 91.7\%, 100\% and 91.7\% vs
53.3\% and 71.7\%). Furthermore, the parameters of integrated backscatter,
MSR, skewness, and kurtosis were significantly correlated to percent
of core area (r = -0.64, -0.73, 0.78, and 0.63, respectively; P<.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with IVUS video images, the parameters of radiofrequency
signal analysis may be used to aid in more accurate detection and
quantitative evaluation of a lipid core, which is one of the major
factors of a vulnerable coronary plaque.},

limited by a lack of diagnostic tools. Intravascular ultrasound elastography
is a new technique based on intravascular ultrasound and has the
potential to differentiate between different plaques phenotypes.
However, the predictive value of intravascular elastography to detect
vulnerable plaques had not been studied. Methods and Results - Postmortem
coronary arteries were investigated with intravascular elastography
and subsequently processed for histology. In histology, a vulnerable
plaque was defined as a plaque consisting of a thin cap (<250 \&mu;m)
with moderate to heavy macrophage infiltration and at least 40\%
of atheroma. In elastography, a vulnerable plaque was defined as
a plaque with a high strain region at the surface with adjacent low
strain regions. In 24 diseased coronary arteries, we studied 54 cross
sections. In histology, 26 vulnerable plaques and 28 nonvulnerable
plaques were found. Receiver operator characteristic analysis revealed
a maximum predictive power for a strain value threshold of 1.26\%.
The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.85.
The sensitivity was 88\%, and the specificity was 89\% to detect
vulnerable plaques. Linear regression showed high correlation between
the strain in caps and the amount of macrophages (P < 0.006) and
an inverse relation between the amount of smooth muscle cells and
strain (P < 0.0001). Plaques, which are declared vulnerable in elastography,
have a thinner cap than nonvulnerable plaques (P < 0.0001). Conclusions
- Intravascular elastography has a high sensitivity and specificity
to detect vulnerable plaques in vitro.},

abstract = {Atherosclerotic plaque disruption with superimposed thrombosis is
the main cause of acute coronary events. At present it is not known
specifically how various risk factors influence the development and
configuration of coronary plaques. The risk of plaque disruption
depends more on plaque composition and vulnerability (plaque type)
than on the degree of stenosis (plaque size). Lipid accumulation
and chronic inflammation, particularly macrophage activities, seem
to influence the development and the stability of a plaque and thus
its propensity to rupture. Macrophages have the ability to secrete
proteolytic enzymes and often infiltrate the region of imminent plaque
rupture, and disruption may be associated with a generalized inflammatory
reaction. Further, plaque disruption tends to occur at points where
the plaque surface is weakest, corresponding to locations where mechanical
and hemodynamic forces have their highest impact. The risk of plaque
disruption is a function of both plaque vulnerability (intrinsic
disease) and rupture triggers (extrinsic forces). The former predisposes
the plaque to rupture; the latter may precipitate rupture. The danger
of vulnerable plaques, however, is not related to disruption as such
but to the resulting thrombosis. The magnitude of this thrombotic
response and the ensuing flow obstruction depends on the contents
and quantity of exposed thrombogenic plaque material, the degree
of pre-existing stenosis, and the systemic thrombotic tendency. The
thrombotic response is a dynamic process that is decisive for the
clinical presentation and the outcome.},

abstract = {A 50 MHz ultrasound backscatter microscope has been built to measure
the acoustic properties of vascular tissues and blood over the frequency
range from 35-65 MHz. High resolution (45 microns) ultrasound backscatter
microscope images of nine femoral and eight common carotid human
artery samples were made and compared with corresponding histological
sections. Individual tissue layers were selected using these images
for quantitative measurement of the frequency dependent backscatter.
Backscatter measurements were made in each layer of an artery at
two different angles of incidence: along the axis of the artery (axial
direction) and at 90 degrees to this measurement radially out from
the center of the artery (radial direction). Scattering was found
to be higher in elastic arteries (carotid) than in the muscular arteries
(femoral). The largest difference was found in the media where the
average scatter (measured in the radial direction at 50 MHz) increased
from 0.002 sr-1 mm-1 in muscular arteries to 0.4 sr-1 mm-1 in elastic
arteries. Large differences in scattering between measurements made
in the axial and radial direction were also found. Again, the largest
differences were found in the media where scattering (at 50 MHz)
in carotid arteries increased from 0.003 sr-1 mm-1 measured in the
axial direction to 0.4 sr-1 mm-1 measured in the radial direction.
The speed of sound and attenuation in the artery wall of each sample
were measured. Speed of sound measurements were found to range between
1579-1628 ms-1. The average attenuation in the artery wall increased
from 4 dB mm-1 at 30 MHz to 10 dB mm-1 at 60 mHz. This is higher
than the attenuation measured in blood which increased from 1.6 dB
mm-1 to 5 dB mm-1 over the same frequency range. The backscatter
coefficient for flowing blood was measured for flow velocities up
to 36 cms-1. At flow velocities below 18 cms-1 a level of scattering
of 0.0005 sr-1 mm-1 (at 50 MHz) was found. An increase in scattering
of 1.6 times was measured when the flow velocity was increased to
36 cms-1. All measurements were made at 37 degrees C. The relevance
of these results to clinical imaging and image interpretation is
discussed.},

abstract = {Changes in vessel wall elasticity may be indicative of vessel pathologies. It is known, for example, that the presence of plaque stiffens the vascular wall, and that the heterogeneity of its composition may lead to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Another domain of application where ultrasound elastography may be of interest is the study of vascular wall elasticity to predict the risk of aneurysmal tissue rupture. In this paper, this technology is introduced as an approach to noninvasively characterize superficial arteries. In such a case, a linear array ultrasound transducer is applied on the skin over the region of interest, and the arterial tissue is dilated by the normal cardiac pulsation. The elastograms, the equivalent elasticity images, are computed from the assessment of the vascular tissue motion. Investigating the forward problem, it is shown that motion parameters might be difficult to interpret; that is because tissue motion occurs radially within the vessel wall while the ultrasound beam propagates axially. As a consequence of that, the elastograms are subjected to hardening and softening artefacts, which are to be counteracted. In this paper, the Von Mises (VM) coefficient is proposed as a new parameter to circumvent such mechanical artefacts and to appropriately characterize the vessel wall. Regarding the motion assessment, the Lagrangian estimator was used; that is because it provides the full two-dimensional strain tensor necessary to compute the VM coefficient. The theoretical model was validated with biomechanical simulations of the vascular wall properties. The results allow believing in the potential of the method to differentiate hard plaques and lipid pools from normal vascular tissue. Potential in vivo implementation of noninvasive vascular elastography to characterize abdominal aneurysms and superficial arteries such as the femoral and the carotid is discussed.},

In this paper, the Lagrangian Speckle Model Estimator (LSME) is formulated

The method was implemented through an adapted version of the Levenberg-Marquardt
minimization algorithm, using the optical flow equations to compute
the Jacobbian matrix. The theoretical framework was validated with
simulated ultrasound rf data of mechanically complex vessel wall

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy lowers the risk of carotid territory
ipsilateral ischaemic stroke, and is the treatment of choice, in
patients with recently symptomatic 70-99\% carotid stenosis. However,
the 3-year risk of stroke on medical treatment alone is only about
20\%. We investigated whether the efficacy of endarterectomy would
be improved if patients with a high risk of stroke on medical treatment
and a low risk of operative stroke or death could be identified.
METHODS: We developed two prognostic models from data on patients
with 0-69\% carotid stenosis in the European Carotid Surgery Trial
(ECST). The medical model predicted risk of ipsilateral carotid territory
major ischaemic stroke (fatal or lasting longer than 7 days) on medical
treatment and the surgical model predicted risk of major stroke and
death within 30 days of endarterectomy. From these models we developed
a prognostic score to identify patients with a high risk of stroke
on medical treatment but a low operative risk. We validated the models
and tested the scoring system on 990 ECST patients with 70-99\% carotid
stenosis assigned surgery (594) or medical treatment only (396).
FINDINGS: When patients with 70-99\% stenosis were stratified by
the scoring system, which was based on seven independent prognostic
factors, endarterectomy was beneficial in only 162 (16\%) patients.
The 5-year absolute risk of carotid territory ipsilateral major ischaemic
stroke, operative major stroke, or death was lowered by 33\% in the
16\% of patients with a score of 4 or more (odds ratio 0.12 [95\%
CI 0.05-0.29], p<0.0001), but not in the other 828 (84\%) patients
(1.00 [0.65-1.54], p=0.7). INTERPRETATION: Many patients with recently
symptomatic 70-99\% carotid stenosis may not benefit from carotid
endarterectomy. Validation of the predictive score is needed on external
datasets, but risk-factor modelling could be useful to identify those
patients in whom endarterectomy will be beneficial.},

abstract = {Commercial bone sonometers measure broadband ultrasonic attenuation and/or speed of sound (SOS) in order to assess bone status. Phase velocity, which is usually measured in frequency domain, is a fundamental material property of bone that is related to SOS, which is usually measured in time domain. Four previous in vitro studies indicate that phase velocity in human cancellous bone decreases with frequency (i.e., negative dispersion). In order to investigate frequency-dependent phase velocity in vivo, through-transmission measurements were performed in 73 women using a GE Lunar Achilles Insight (R) commercial bone sonometer. Average phase velocity at 500 kHz was 1489 +/- 55 m/s (mean standard deviation). Average dispersion rate was -59 +/- 52 m/sMHz. Group velocity was usually lower than phase velocity, as is expected for negatively dispersive media. Using a stratified model to represent cancellous bone, the reductions in phase velocity and dispersion rate in vivo as opposed to in vitro can be explained by (1) the presence of marrow instead of water as a fluid filler, and (2) the decreased porosity of bones of living (compared with deceased) subjects.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential
of magnetic resonance (MR) to detect arterial thrombotic obstruction
and define thrombus age. BACKGROUND; Arterial thrombi underlie the
clinical consequences of atherosclerosis and are not reliably detected
by current noninvasive diagnostic techniques. METHODS: Carotid thrombi
were induced in swine (n = 7) by arterial injury. Serial high-resolution
in vivo MR images were obtained using black-blood T1-weighted (T1W)
and T2-weighted (T2W) sequences in a clinical 1.5T MR system at 6
h, 1 day and at 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9 weeks. At each time point one animal
was sacrificed and the occluded carotid artery processed for histopathology.
Thrombus signal intensity (SI) was normalized to that of the adjacent
muscle. Thrombus age was assessed based on MR appearance by two blinded
independent observers. RESULTS: Thrombus appearance and relative
SI revealed characteristic temporal changes in multicontrast-weighted
MR images, reflecting histologic changes in the composition. Acute
thrombus appeared very bright on the T2W images, facilitating the
detection. Signal intensity was 197 +/- 25\% at 6 h, peaking at 1
week (246 +/- 51\%), reaching a plateau by 6 weeks (120 +/- 15\%).
At six weeks, complete thrombus organization was confirmed histologically.
The T1W images had similar pattern with lower SI than T2W. Age definition
using visual appearance was highly accurate (Pearson's chi-square
with 4 df ranging from 96 to 132 and Cohen's kappa at 0.81 to 0.94).
Agreement between observers was substantial (Pearson chi-square with
4 df = 91.5, kappa = 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging
is a promising tool to noninvasively detect arterial thrombosis.
Measurement of SI and the characteristic visual appearance of the
thrombus have the potential to define thrombus age.},

METHODS: Twenty participants (mean age, 69.8 years [standard deviation]
+/- 10.5; 75\% men) with 16\%-79\% carotid stenosis at duplex ultrasonography
were imaged with 1.5-T and 3.0-T MR imaging units with bilateral
four-element phased-array surface coils. This HIPAA-compliant study
was approved by the institutional review board, and all participants
gave written informed consent. Protocols designed for similar signal-to-noise
ratios across platforms were implemented to acquire axial T1-weighted,
T2-weighted, intermediate-weighted, time-of-flight, and contrast
material-enhanced T1-weighted images. Lumen area, wall area, total
vessel area, wall thickness, and presence or absence and area of
plaque components were documented. Continuous variables from different
field strengths were compared by using the intraclass correlation
coefficient (ICC) and repeated measures analysis. The Cohen kappa
was used to evaluate agreement between 1.5 T and 3.0 T on compositional
dichotomous variables. RESULTS: There was a strong level of agreement
between field strengths for all morphologic variables, with ICCs
ranging from 0.88 to 0.96. Agreement in the identification of presence
or absence of plaque components was very good for calcification (kappa
= 0.72), lipid-rich necrotic core (kappa = 0.73), and hemorrhage
(kappa = 0.66). However, the visualization of hemorrhage was greater
at 1.5 T than at 3.0 T (14.7\% vs 7.8\%, P < .001). Calcifications
measured significantly (P = .03) larger at 3.0 T, while lipid-rich
necrotic cores without hemorrhage were similar between field strengths
(P = .9). CONCLUSION: At higher field strengths, the increased susceptibility
of calcification and paramagnetic ferric iron in hemorrhage may alter
quantification and/or detection. Nevertheless, imaging criteria at
1.5 T for carotid vessel wall interpretation are applicable at 3.0

had atherosclerosis. Imaging demonstrated focal accumulation of radiolabel
consistent with 99mTc-LDL sequestration by plaques in the carotid,
iliac, or femoral vessels of four patients 8 to 21 hours after intravenous
injection of the radiopharmaceutical. Focal accumulation of 99mTc-LDL
also appeared in the location of coronary lesions in four patients,
but this accumulation could not be distinguished with certainty from
residual blood pool radioactivity. When carotid endarterectomy specimens
from six patients who received 99mTc-LDL 1 day before endarterectomy
were examined, the specimens had focal accumulations of radiolabel,
with two to four times greater radioactivity in some regions of each
specimen than in others; this occurred whether or not the lesions
were detected on the gamma camera images. Lesion composition may
have determined whether accumulation was quantitatively sufficient
to produce an external image. Histologically, the imaged carotid
specimen had abundant foam cells and macrophages and poorly organized
intramural blood consistent with a plaque hemorrhage; in contrast,
nonimaged endarterectomy specimens were mature, fibrocalcific plaques.
We conclude that: 1) 99mTc-LDL did accumulate in human atherosclerotic
plaques; 2) in some patients, the accumulation of 99mTc-LDL was sufficient
for detection by gamma camera imaging; 3) the amount of LDL that
accumulated appeared to depend on lesion composition; and 4) the
design of new radiopharmaceuticals with reduced residual blood pool
activity relative to plaque accumulation should lead to improved
external imaging of atherosclerosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In vitro studies of atherosclerotic plaque
fracture mechanics suggest that analysis of local variations in surface
deformability may provide information on relative vulnerability to
plaque fissuring or rupture. We investigated plaque surface deformations
in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery disease
using 4-dimensional ultrasonography and techniques for measuring
optical flow. METHODS: Four-dimensional ultrasound examinations of
carotid artery plaques were performed in 23 asymptomatic and 22 symptomatic
patients with 50\% to 90\% stenosis of the internal carotid artery.
Plaque surface motion during 1 cardiac cycle was computed with a
hierarchical model-based motion estimator. Results were compared
with plaque echogenicity and surface structure. RESULTS: Of the 45
patients examined, plaque surface motion estimates were obtained
for 18 asymptomatic and 13 symptomatic patients. There were no significant
differences in echogenicity or surface structure of asymptomatic
and symptomatic plaques (P>0.05). Results of motion estimation showed
that asymptomatic plaques had surface motion vectors of equal orientation
and magnitude to those of the internal carotid artery, whereas symptomatic
plaques demonstrated evidence of inherent plaque movement. There
was no significant difference in maximal plaque velocity between
symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques (P<0.14). Maximal discrepant
surface velocity (MDSV) in symptomatic plaques was 3.85+/-1.26 mm/s
(mean+/-SD), which was significantly higher (P<0.001) than MDSV of
asymptomatic plaques with 0.58+/-0.42 mm/s (mean+/-SD). CONCLUSIONS:
++MDSV of carotid artery plaques is significantly different in asymptomatic
and symptomatic disease. Further studies are warranted to determine
whether plaque surface motion patterns can identify vulnerable plaques
in patients with carotid artery stenosis.},

abstract = {Although coronary atherosclerosis is the leading cause of hospitalization and death in the United States, at present no effective diagnostic technique is available to effectively characterize atherosclerotic plaque in vivo and in real-time. In 'Introduction' of this article, we propose the use of an impedance-based technique to diagnose the presence of atherosclerotic plaque. Both analytical and finite element methods are developed to study the effect of a multi-layer substrate in contact with a sensor on the sensor's electro-mechanical impedance. Also a modified version of the Krimholtz, Leedom, and Matthaei (KLM) model is introduced to design the sensor dimension based on a sensor/plaque configuration. An appropriate fabrication technique for manufacturing a small-scale PZT sensor is also proposed for possible use in small arteries. In section 'Analytical Model' of the article, we show that the presence of plaque can be accurately predicted by using the proposed impedance-probing technique on samples of human, atherosclerotic tissues. The presence of atherosclerotic plaque in the samples - as predicted by our technique - is confirmed by a histological examination carried out at the Stanford Histology Research Core Lab. The plaque mechanical properties are approximated based on a modified KLM model describing the sensor-artery system. The properties predicted are found to be consistent with the values reported in the literature. A brief study pertaining to the pressure necessary to achieve an acceptable contact between the PZT sensors and the probed artery is presented in the last section of the article. This work suggests that it is possible to characterize atherosclerotic plaque in real-time using the described impedance-based monitoring technique. One future possible application for this technique could be - for instance - the detection of unstable plaque in arteries prior to percutaneous transmural angioplasty (PTA).},

abstract = {Tissue elasticity can be estimated from displacement and strain images acquired under controlled deformation, We extend this approach for coronary arteries, deformed and imaged by an integrated angioplasty balloon and ultrasonic imaging probe. Because the lumen cross section of a severely occluded artery is not circular, we have also developed a technique to perform all motion computations in the reference frame of the lumen's geometric center. This coordinate system is independent of the imaging catheter and consequently referencing to this frame removes artifacts associated with probe motion within the balloon during deformation, Displacements and strains estimated by phase-sensitive correlation-based speckle tracking were used to distinguish arterial plaques in simulated coronary arteries of differing elastic moduli: hard, soft, and homogenous. We have also applied these methods to images of a homogeneous gelatin phantom collected with the integrated probe, The maximum phantom displacement was about 40 mu m, and the maximum radial normal strain was about 4\% (absolute value), The spatial dependence of these quantities shows good agreement with theoretically predicted values.},

abstract = {Palpography assesses the local mechanical properties of tissue using the deformation caused by the intraluminal pressure. The technique was validated in vitro using diseased human coronary and femoral arteries. Especially between fibrous and fatty tissue, a highly significant difference in strain (p = 0.0012) was found. Additionally, the predictive value to identify the vulnerable plaque was investigated. A high-strain region at the lumen vessel wall boundary has 88\% sensitivity and 89\% specificity for identifying these plaques. In vivo, the technique is validated in an atherosclerotic Yucatan minipig animal model. This study also revealed higher strain values in fatty than in fibrous plaques (p < 0.001). The presence of a high-strain region at the lumen-plaque interface has a high predictive value to identify macrophages. Patient studies revealed high strain values (1\% to 2\%) in noncalcified plaques. Calcified material showed low strain values (0\% to 0.2\%). With the development of three-dimensional palpography, identification of weak spots over the full length of a coronary artery becomes available. Patients with myocardial infarction or unstable angina have more high-strain spots in their coronary arteries than patients with stable angina. In conclusion, intravascular palpography is a unique tool to assess lesion composition and vulnerability. Three-dimensional palpography provides a technique that may develop into a clinically available tool for decision making to treat hemodynamically nonsignificant lesions by identifying vulnerable plaques. The clinical utility of this technique is yet to be determined, and more investigation is needed.},

abstract = {Motion of the carotid atheromatous plaque may be responsible for plaque rupture and cerebrovascular symptoms. B-mode ultrasound allows non-invasive recording of arterial wall and plaque motion. Our aim was to analyze quantitatively patterns of arterial wall motion with different techniques. Temporal sequences of digitized B-mode ultrasound images of the carotid arteries of 10 young healthy subjects were interrogated. Arterial wall motion was analyzed using: a/ block-matching, and b/ optical flow. The motion of selected regions of the luminal surface of the arterial wall was estimated using region tracking and block-matching. The motion of areas of the arterial wall was estimated using optical flow. Waveforms showing radial and axial displacements, as well as radial and axial velocities were produced for the selected ROIs using both techniques. Both techniques produced waveforms with peaks, corresponding to cardiac cycle events, that occurred at similar time points. To study the similarity of the waveforms obtained from the two techniques, a cross-correlation coefficient was calculated. Cross-correlation coefficients were 0.72..0.22 and 0.70..0.19 for displacements and velocities, respectively, in the radial direction. In the axial direction, the coefficients were 0.32..0.39 and 0.24..0.22 for displacements and velocities, respectively. On the basis of this relative comparison of methods, we conclude that significant observations can be made for each motion analysis technique in terms of characterization of the mechanical properties of the tissue.},

An imbalanced metabolism may lead to uncontrolled collagen accumulation reducing vessel wall velocity, frequently resulting in arterial occlusion or thrombosis. A reduced production of collagen and its uncontrolled degradation may affect the stability of the vessel wall and especially of the atherosclerotic plaques by making them prone to rupture and aneurysm. This review presents an overview on the four groups of vascular collagens and on their role in atherogenesis. The major focus was to highlight the extraordinary role and importance of the short chain network forming type VIII collagen in the extracellular matrix of undiseased arteries and of atherosclerotic plaques. The molecular structure of type VIII collagen, its cellular origin, its implication in atherogenesis, its temporal and spatial expression patterns in human and experimental models of atherogenesis, the factors modulating its expression, and--not at least--its potential function is discussed.},

abstract = {Atherosclerotic plaque rupture may occur when regions of weakened
extracellular matrix are subjected to increased mechanical stresses.
Since collagen is a major determinant of extracellular matrix strength,
enzymes that degrade collagen may play an important role in destabilizing
the atherosclerotic lesion. To test the hypothesis that matrix metalloproteinase
1 (interstitial collagenase, or MMP-1), which initiates degradation
of fibrillar collagens, colocalizes with increased stress in the
fibrous cap of the atherosclerotic lesion, 12 unruptured human coronary
lesions were studied. Finite-element analysis was used to determine
the distribution of stress in the lesion, with estimates of material
properties from previous measurements of human tissues. A computerized
image analysis system was used to determine the distribution of immunoreactive
MMP-1 within the fibrous tissue of the lesion. There was a significant
correlation between immunoreactive MMP-1 and circumferential tensile
stress in the fibrous cap within a given lesion (median Spearman
rank correlation coefficient, .36; interquartile range, -.02 to .81;
P < .02). Within a given lesion, the highest-stress region had twofold
greater MMP-1 expression than the lowest-stress regions. In unruptured
human atherosclerotic coronary lesions, overexpression of MMP-1 is
associated with increased circumferential stress in the fibrous plaque.
Degradation and weakening of the collagenous extracellular matrix
at these critical high-stress regions may play a role in the pathogenesis
of plaque rupture and acute ischemic syndromes.},

of stroke. This study evaluates the efficacy of adding longitudinal
black-blood (BB) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) angiography
to cross-sectional CMR images in the identification of carotid atherosclerotic
ulceration. METHODS: Thirty-two subjects (30 males and two females
with ages between 48 and 83 years) scheduled for carotid endarterectomy
were imaged on a 1.5T GE Signa scanner using multisequence [3D time-of-flight,
T1, proton density, T2, contrast enhanced T1], cross-sectional CMR
images and longitudinal BB CMR angiography (0.625 x 0.625 mm/pixel).
Two rounds of review (round 1: cross-sectional CMR images alone and
round 2: cross-sectional CMR images plus longitudinal BB CMR angiography)
were conducted for the presence and volume measurements of ulceration.
Ulceration was defined as a distinct depression into the plaque containing
blood flow signal on cross-sectional CMR and longitudinal BB CMR
angiography. RESULTS: Of the 32 plaques examined by histology, 17
contained 21 ulcers. Using the longitudinal BB CMR angiography sequence
in addition to the cross-sectional CMR images in round 2, the sensitivity
improved to 80\% for ulcers of at least 6 mm3 in volume by histology
and 52.4\% for all ulcers, compared to 30\% and 23.8\% in round 1,
respectively. There was a slight decline in specificity from 88.2\%
to 82.3\%, though both the positive and negative predictive values
increased modestly from 71.4\% to 78.6\% and from 48.4\% to 58.3\%,
respectively. CONCLUSION: The addition of longitudinal BB CMR angiography
to multisequence cross-sectional CMR images increases accuracy in
the identification of carotid atherosclerotic ulceration.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rupture of thin-cap fibroatheromatous plaques is a major cause of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Such plaques can be identified in vitro by 3D intravascular palpography with high sensitivity and specificity. We used this technique in patients undergoing percutaneous intervention to assess the incidence of mechanically deformable regions. We further explored the relation of such regions to clinical presentation and to C-reactive protein levels. METHOD AND RESULTS: Three-dimensional palpograms were derived from continuous intravascular ultrasound pullbacks. Patients (n=55) were classified by clinical presentation as having stable angina, unstable angina, or AMI. In every patient, 1 coronary artery was scanned (culprit vessel in stable and unstable angina, nonculprit vessel in AMI), and the number of deformable plaques assessed. Stable angina patients had significantly fewer deformable plaques per vessel (0.6+/-0.6) than did unstable angina patients (P=0.0019) (1.6+/-0.7) or AMI patients (P<0.0001) (2.0+/-0.7). Levels of C-reactive protein were positively correlated with the number of mechanically deformable plaques (R2=0.65, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional intravascular palpography detects strain patterns in human coronary arteries that represent the level of deformation in plaques. The number of highly deformable plaques is correlated with both clinical presentation and levels of C-reactive protein. Further studies will assess the potential role of the technique to identify patients at risk of future clinical events},

coefficient, and axial strain properties of atherosclerotic plaque

a carotid endarterectomy procedure, characterization of in vivo properties
of atherosclerotic plaque is essential. The relatively shallow depth
of the carotid artery and plaque enables non-invasive evaluation
of carotid plaque utilizing high frequency linear-array transducers.
We investigate the ability of the attenuation coefficient and equivalent
scatterer size parameters to differentiate between calcified, and
lipidic plaque tissue. Softer plaques especially lipid rich and those
with a thin fibrous cap are more prone to rupture and can be classified
as unstable or vulnerable plaque. Preliminary results were obtained
from 10 human patients whose carotid artery was scanned in vivo to
evaluate atherosclerotic plaque prior to a carotid endarterectomy
procedure. Our results indicate that the equivalent scatterer size
obtained using Faran's scattering theory for calcified regions are
in the 120-180mum range while softer regions have larger equivalent
scatterer size distribution in the 280-470mum range. The attenuation
coefficient for calcified regions as expected is significantly higher
than that for softer regions. In the frequency bandwidth ranging
from 2.5 to 7.5MHz, the attenuation coefficient for calcified regions
lies between 1.4 and 2.5dB/cm/MHz, while that for softer regions
lies between 0.3 and 1.3dB/cm/MHz.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because many acute cerebral ischemic events are caused
by rupture of vulnerable carotid atheroma and subsequent thrombosis,
the present study used both idealized and patient-specific carotid
atheromatous plaque models to evaluate the effect of structural determinants
on stress distributions within plaque. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using
a finite element method, structural analysis was performed using
models derived from in vivo high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) of carotid atheroma in 40 non-consecutive patients (20 symptomatic,
20 asymptomatic). Plaque components were modeled as hyper-elastic
materials. The effects of varying fibrous cap thickness, lipid core
size and lumen curvature on plaque stress distributions were examined.
Lumen curvature and fibrous cap thickness were found to be major
determinants of plaque stress. The size of the lipid core did not
alter plaque stress significantly when the fibrous cap was relatively
thick. The correlation between plaque stress and lumen curvature
was significant for both symptomatic (p=0.01; correlation coefficient:
0.689) and asymptomatic patients (p=0.01; correlation coefficient:
0.862). Lumen curvature in plaques of symptomatic patients was significantly
larger than those of asymptomatic patients (1.50+/-1.0 mm(-1) vs
1.25+/-0.75 mm(-1); p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Specific plaque morphology
(large lumen curvature and thin fibrous cap) is closely related to
plaque vulnerability. Structural analysis using high-resolution MRI
of carotid atheroma may help in detecting vulnerable atheromatous
plaque and aid the risk stratification of patients with carotid disease.},

abstract = {We evaluated quantitative ultrasonic methods for assessment of carotid plaque content. In vitro measurements of fixed, carotid plaque specimens obtained by surgical endarterectomy were performed using a clinical Philips HDI 5000 imaging system connected to a radiofrequency (RF) signal-acquisition system. We acquired RF signals and grey-scale images from carotid specimens (n = 17) and a tissue-mimicking reference phantom. Imaged plaque sections were then classified according to histology. Parametric images were constructed from the integrated backscatter (IBS), and the midband, slope and intercept values of a straight-line fit to the apparent backscatter transfer function. Analysis was performed on 82 regions-of-interest (ROIs). The IBS values for collagen, lipid and hemorrhage plaques were 5.8 +/- 5.4, 3.9 +/- 3.7, 2.8 +/- 2.2 dB, respectively. Midband and IBS parameter images exhibited good agreement in morphology with histology, whereas the slope and intercept parameter images were noisy. Mean IBS, midband, and grey-scale values of complex plaques were found to be statistically different (p < 0.05) from lipid, hemorrhage and fibrolipid plaques. The bias and limits of agreement (1.3 +/- 4.9 dB) between the grey-scale and IBS methods, however, indicated that the two methods were not interchangeable. Results indicate necessary improvements, such as reduction of large measurement variances and identification of robust parameters, that will permit multiparametric characterization of carotid plaque under in vivo conditions.},

@article{Bridal2000,
abstract = {The goal of this study was to develop methods for quantitative ultrasound
imagery suitable for noninvasive assessment of carotid plaque composition
prior to the selection of the technique for revascularization. Using
two broadband transducers (5-12 MHz and 12-28 MHz), backscattered
radio frequency signals were acquired from entire lengths of 15 carotid
endarterectomy specimens. Spectral analysis methods with correction
for system response and beam diffraction were applied to radio frequency
signals from local volumes of plaque having a 2 mm slice thickness,
1 mm width and axial depth of 480 microm and 240 microm at 10 MHz
and 20 MHz, respectively. From these spectra, local values of four
ultrasound parameters (integrated backscatter, frequency dependence
of backscatter, integrated attenuation and slope of attenuation)
were estimated and used to construct quantitative images. To combine
information from these different parameter images, a two-step approach
was followed. First, in 59 independent quantitative images of highly
stenotic plaque, the average parameter values in a central five-by-three
pixel region were correlated with plaque composition as assessed
by histology to investigate the relationship between parameter values,
frequency bandwidth and plaque composition. Discriminant analysis
of parameter values vs. plaque composition was made to find a set
of predictive equations to classify sets of measurements. Correct
classification was obtained for 100\% of calcified, 75\% of intraplaque
hemorrhage and 71\% of lipidic plaques of the input data set. Second,
each set of pixels from different parameter images was classified
using the predictive equations, and a single, local tissue composition
image was constructed. Examples of tissue composition images are
presented in comparison with corresponding histologic sections. Both
agreement and disagreement between image pairs are discussed.},
