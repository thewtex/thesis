  abstract = {A technique is described for measuring the local hardness of the vessel
	wall and atheroma using intravascular ultrasound, Strain images mere
	constructed using the relative local displacements, which are estimated
	from the time shifts between gated echo signals acquired at two levels
	of intravascular pressure, Time shifts were estimated using one-dimensional
	correlation with bandlimited interpolation around the peak, Tissue-mimicking
	phantoms with the typical morphology and hardness topology of some
	atherosclerotic vessels were constructed, Hard and soft regions could
	be distinguished on the strain image, independently of their contrast
	in echogenicity, Thus, the potential of ultrasonic hardness imaging
	to provide information that may be unavailable from the echogram
	alone was demonstrated, The strain images of the homogeneous and
	layered phantoms showed some artifacts that need to be corrected
	for, to obtain images of the modulus of elasticity, For in vitro
	and in vivo experiments, the spatial resolution of the technique
	needs to be improved, Furthermore, two-dimensional correlation techniques
	may be necessary in case of nonradial expansion and an off-centre
	catheter position, (C) 1997 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE--To determine whether the addition of carotid endarterectomy
	to aggressive medical management can reduce the incidence of cerebral
	infarction in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.
	DESIGN--Prospective, randomized, multicenter trial. SETTING--Thirty-nine
	clinical sites across the United States and Canada. PATIENTS--Between
	December 1987 and December 1993, a total of 1662 patients with asymptomatic
	carotid artery stenosis of 60\% or greater reduction in diameter
	were randomized; follow-up data are available on 1659. At baseline,
	recognized risk factors for stroke were similar between the two treatment
	groups. INTERVENTION--Daily aspirin administration and medical risk
	factor management for all patients; carotid endarterectomy for patients
	randomized to receive surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Initially,
	transient ischemic attack or cerebral infarction occurring in the
	distribution of the study artery and any transient ischemic attack,
	stroke, or death occurring in the perioperative period. In March
	1993, the primary outcome measures were changed to cerebral infarction
	occurring in the distribution of the study artery or any stroke or
	death occurring in the perioperative period. RESULTS--After a median
	follow-up of 2.7 years, with 4657 patient-years of observation, the
	aggregate risk over 5 years for ipsilateral stroke and any perioperative
	stroke or death was estimated to be 5.1\% for surgical patients and
	11.0\% for patients treated medically (aggregate risk reduction of
	53\% [95\% confidence interval, 22\% to 72\%]). CONCLUSION--Patients
	with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis of 60\% or greater reduction
	in diameter and whose general health makes them good candidates for
	elective surgery will have a reduced 5-year risk of ipsilateral stroke
	if carotid endarterectomy performed with less than 3\% perioperative
	morbidity and mortality is added to aggressive management of modifiable
	risk factors.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose-The aim of this study was to evaluate a computer-assisted
	technique to characterize atherosclerotic plaque. Methods-In 9 subjects
	(7 men, 2 women; mean age 33 years), known anatomic areas (carotid,
	fat, muscle, iliotibial tract, and tibia) were scanned with an Acuson
	duplex ultrasound machine with 72 machine settings. The ultrasound
	images of these anatomic areas were recorded on magneto-optical disks.
	Echo amplitude statistics were obtained, and the mean pixel value
	(MPV) was used to assess the level of echogenicity. The ideal settings
	of this particular scanner for optimal discrimination between these
	tissues types were identified by the Heuristic Index of Discrimination.
	With these settings, carotid artery scanning was performed on 17
	patients (15 men, 2 women; mean age 65 years), and the image analysis
	of their ultrasound carotid plaques was compared with their histological
	findings. Results-In this study, discrimination between the selected
	tissues was found to be optimal when the controls were set at log
	40 dB, 0/2/0, and gain of -5 dB. The MPV of the carotid specimens
	scanned at this setting correlated significantly with the histological
	findings (Spearman correlation, P=0.002). Conclusions-Computer-assisted
	image analysis to give the MPV is a technique that may be used to
	identify unstable atherosclerotic plaques reliably.},

  abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that
	may involve the whole gut. Marked intestinal T cell and macrophage
	activation is a key feature of the disease. Polymorphonuclear cell
	infiltration is also observed in the diseased gut, mainly during
	active inflammation. Scintigraphic detection of granulocytes and
	activated lymphocytes infiltrating the gut wall may be useful in
	identifying a subgroup of patients with clinically inactive CD who
	are undergoing early clinical relapse. The aims of the present study
	were (a) to compare the effectiveness of scintigraphy with (99m)Tc-labelled
	interleukin-2 ((99m)Tc-IL2) and with (99m)Tc-HMPAO labelled granulocytes
	((99m)Tc-WBC) in detecting the presence and extent of bowel inflammation
	in patients with long-term inactive CD (>12 months) and (b) to assess
	the accuracy of these techniques in predicting future disease relapse.
	We studied 29 patients with ileal and/or colonic CD in stable clinical
	remission (Crohn's Disease Activity Index <150 for at least 12 months)
	using both (99m)Tc-IL2 and (99m)Tc-WBC scintigraphy in order to evaluate
	the extent of acute and chronic inflammation in the bowel. Planar
	and single-photon emission tomography images were acquired in each
	patient at 1 h p.i. For quantitative analysis of (99m)Tc-IL2 uptake,
	the abdomen was divided into 32 regions of interest. Despite the
	absence of symptoms, 18 patients (62\%) showed a positive (99m)Tc-IL2
	and 18 (62\%) a positive (99m)Tc-WBC scan. Only 12 patients (41.4\%
	of the total group) were positive on both scans, and the sites of
	IL2 and granulocyte bowel uptake were usually located in different
	segments, indicating that in CD, acute and chronic inflammation can
	be present in different sites. As far as the prognostic role of the
	two scans in predicting future disease relapse is concerned, both
	(99m)Tc-IL2 and (99m)Tc-WBC scintigraphy showed a high negative predictive
	value (1.00 and 0.91, respectively) but a weak positive predictive
	value (0.44 and 0.39, respectively). Nevertheless, Kaplan-Meier curves
	generated between scintigraphic findings and time free from disease
	relapse were statistically different only for (99m)Tc-IL2 scintigraphy
	(log-rank test, P=0.013). These results indicate that (99m)Tc-IL2
	scintigraphy can be useful in selecting CD patients in clinical remission
	who could benefit from preventive therapy to avoid disease relapse.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the accuracy of the main Doppler methods for
	quantifying the degree of carotid stenoses in 133 patients. METHOD:
	seven parameters were measured: maximum velocity (V.max) inside the
	stenosis (by pulsed wave [PW]), grade and index of spectral disturbance
	(STI) at the outlet of the stenosis (by PW and continuous wave [CW]),
	ratio of velocities I(IC/CC) in the internal and common carotid (by
	PW), and ratio of vessel cross-section and residual lumen area (\%Color)
	inside the stenosis (color Doppler). The reference methods were the
	grades of spectral disturbance and the STI (by CW), already validated
	against endarterectomy specimens. CONCLUSION: For poststenosis measurements,
	a high correlation was found between the grades or STI measured by
	PW and CW (reference method). The measurement of these parameters
	was easier in PW mode. For intrastenotic velocity, the increase in
	V.max was not proportional to the degree of stenosis, and V.max showed
	large fluctuations for the same degree of stenosis. I(IC/CC) also
	showed large fluctuations for the same degree of stenosis. The correlation
	was poor for these two parameters, which could only be used for detecting
	two groups of stenosis: >75\% or >90\% in area. Color Doppler (conventional
	and power) routinely overestimated the degree of stenosis by 10\%-15\%
	but correlated better with the reference method and was more accurate
	and reproducible than V.max. A special procedure can be used to avoid
	this overestimation and improve the accuracy of the color Doppler.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that carotid endarterectomy
	in patients with symptomatic severe carotid stenosis (defined as
	stenosis of 70 to 99 percent of the luminal diameter) is beneficial
	up to two years after the procedure. In this clinical trial, we assessed
	the benefit of carotid endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic
	moderate stenosis, defined as stenosis of less than 70 percent. We
	also studied the durability of the benefit of endarterectomy in patients
	with severe stenosis over eight years of follow-up. METHODS: Patients
	who had moderate carotid stenosis and transient ischemic attacks
	or nondisabling strokes on the same side as the stenosis (ipsilateral)
	within 180 days before study entry were stratified according to the
	degree of stenosis (50 to 69 percent or <50 percent) and randomly
	assigned either to undergo carotid endarterectomy (1108 patients)
	or to receive medical care alone (1118 patients). The average follow-up
	was five years, and complete data on outcome events were available
	for 99.7 percent of the patients. The primary outcome event was any
	fatal or nonfatal stroke ipsilateral to the stenosis for which the
	patient underwent randomization. RESULTS: Among patients with stenosis
	of 50 to 69 percent, the five-year rate of any ipsilateral stroke
	(failure rate) was 15.7 percent among patients treated surgically
	and 22.2 percent among those treated medically (P=0.045); to prevent
	one ipsilateral stroke during the five-year period, 15 patients would
	have to be treated with carotid endarterectomy. Among patients with
	less than 50 percent stenosis, the failure rate was not significantly
	lower in the group treated with endarterectomy (14.9 percent) than
	in the medically treated group (18.7 percent, P=0.16). Among the
	patients with severe stenosis who underwent endarterectomy, the 30-day
	rate of death or disabling ipsilateral stroke persisting at 90 days
	was 2.1 percent; this rate increased to only 6.7 percent at 8 years.
	Benefit was greatest among men, patients with recent stroke as the
	qualifying event, and patients with hemispheric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS:
	Endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic moderate carotid stenosis
	of 50 to 69 percent yielded only a moderate reduction in the risk
	of stroke. Decisions about treatment for patients in this category
	must take into account recognized risk factors, and exceptional surgical
	skill is obligatory if carotid endarterectomy is to be performed.
	Patients with stenosis of less than 50 percent did not benefit from
	surgery. Patients with severe stenosis (> or =70 percent) had a durable
	benefit from endarterectomy at eight years of follow-up.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The structural features that underlie carotid plaque disruption
	and symptoms are largely unknown. We have previously shown that the
	chemical composition and structural complexity of critical carotid
	stenoses are related to plaque size regardless of symptoms. To further
	determine whether the spatial distribution of individual plaque components
	in relation to the lumen corresponds to symptomatic outcome, we evaluated
	99 carotid endarterectomy plaques. Methods: Indications for operation
	were symptomatic disease in 59 instances (including hemispheric transient
	ischemic attack in 29, stroke in 19, and amaurosis fugax in 11) and
	angiographic asymptomatic stenosis >75\% in 40. Plaques removed after
	remote symp toms beyond 6 months were excluded. Histologic sections
	from the most stenotic region of the plaque were examined using computer-assisted
	morphometric analysis. The per cent area of plaque cross-section
	occupied by necrotic lipid core with or without associated plaque
	hematoma, by calcification, as well as the distance from the lumen
	or fibrous cap of each of these features, were determined. The presence
	of foam cells, macrophages, and inflammatory cell collections within,
	on, or just beneath the fibrous cap was taken as an additional indication
	of plaque neoformation. Results: The mean percent angiographic stenosis
	was 82\% +/- 11\% and 79\% +/- 13\% for the asymptomatic and symptomatic
	groups, respectively (p > 0.05). The necrotic core was twice as close
	to the lumen in symptomatic plaques when compared with asymptomatic
	plaques (0.27 +/- 0.3 mm vs 0.5 +/- 0.5 mm; P < 0.01). The percent
	area of necrotic core or calcification was similar for both groups
	(22\% vs 26\% and 7\% vs 6\%, respectively). There was no significant
	relationship to symptom production of either the distance of calcification
	from the lumen or of the percent area occupied by the lipid necrotic
	core or calcification. The number of macrophages infiltrating the
	region of the fibrous cap was three times greater in the symptomatic
	plaques compared with the asymptomatic plaques (1114 +/- 1104 vs
	385 +/- 622, respectively, P < 0.009). Regions of fibrous cap disruption
	or ulceration were more commonly observed in the symptomatic plaques
	than in the asymptomatic plaques (32\% vs 20\%). None of the demographic
	or clinical atherosclerosis risk factors distinguished between symptomatic
	and asymptomatic plaques. Conclusions: These findings indicate that
	proximity of plaque necrotic core to the lumen and cellular indicators
	of plaque neoformation or inflammatory reaction about the fibrous
	cap are associated with clinical ischemic events. The morphologic
	complexity of carotid stenoses does not appear to determine symptomatic
	outcome but rather the topography of individual plaque components
	in relation to the fibrous cap and the lumen. Imaging techniques
	that precisely resolve the position of the necrotic core and evidence
	of inflammatory reactions within carotid plaques should help identify
	high-risk stenoses before disruption and symptomatic carotid disease.},

	risk factors for the ischemic stroke and studied the interaction
	between hsCRP level and the extent of carotid atherosclerosis. METHODS
	AND RESULTS: We studied 104 patients aged between 30 to 92 years
	who were admitted to our neurology department with acute ischemic
	stroke. All patients underwent a clinical evaluation, laboratory
	investigations, and neuroultrasonographic examination. In 24 patients
	with normal ultrasonographic examination, mean hsCRP levels was 8.6
	+ 6.7 mg/L. Mean hsCRP level was 18.0 + 25.6 mg/L in patients having
	increased intima to media thickness (> 1.2 mm); 32.7 + 49.1 mg/L
	in patients who had atheromatous plaques without significant narrowing;
	and 23.9 + 27.3 mg/L in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis
	more than 50\%. hsCRP levels and the extent of the atherosclerosis
	showed a significant relationship (p = 0.040). In multiple regression
	analyses, this relationship was found to be independent of other
	proven risk factors. The only variable that showed a significant
	relation with the level of hsCRP was the HDL level. A negative correlation
	was found between hsCRP and HDL levels. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude
	that elevated hsCRP level is an indirect risk factor for the ischemic
	stroke through its relation with the extent of the carotid atherosclerosis,
	and this relation is independent of other known risk factors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic lesions are heterogeneous and prognosis
	cannot easily be predicted, even with intracoronary ultrasound and
	angioscopy. Serial angiographic and necropsy studies suggest that
	the risk of plaque rupture correlates only weakly with the degree
	of stenosis. Most ruptured plaques are characterised by a large pool
	of cholesterol or necrotic debris and a thin fibrous cap with a dense
	infiltration of macrophages. The release of matrix-digesting enzymes
	by these cells is thought to contribute to plaque rupture. Other
	thromboses are found on non-ruptured but inflamed plaque surfaces.
	We postulated that both types of thrombotic events may be predicted
	by heat released by activated macrophages either on the plaque surface
	or under a thin cap. METHODS: To test the hypothesis, we measured
	the intimal surface temperatures at 20 sites in each of 50 samples
	of carotid artery taken at endarterectomy from 48 patients. The living
	samples were probed with a thermistor (24-gauge needle-tip; accuracy
	0.1 degree C; time contrast 0.15 s). The tissues were then fixed
	and stained. FINDINGS: Plaques showed several regions in which the
	surface temperatures varied reproducibly by 0.2-0.3 degrees C, but
	37\% of plaques had substantially warmer regions (0.4-2.2 degrees
	C). Points with substantially different temperatures could not be
	distinguished from one another by the naked eye; such points could
	also be very close to one another (< 1 mm apart). Temperature correlated
	positively with cell density (r = 0.68, p = 0.0001) and inversely
	with the distance of the cell clusters from the luminal surface (r
	= -0.38, p = 0.0006). Most cells were macrophages. Infrared thermographic
	images also revealed heterogeneity in temperature among the plaques.
	INTERPRETATION: Living atherosclerotic plaques show thermal heterogeneity,
	which raises the possibility that an infrared catheter or other techniques
	that can localise heat or metabolic activity might be able to identify

	to be the cause of most acute coronary syndromes, the mechanism of
	plaque rupture is controversial. METHODS AND RESULTS. To test the
	hypothesis that plaque rupture occurs at sites of high circumferential
	stress in the diseased vessel, the distribution of stress was analyzed
	in 24 coronary artery lesions. Histological specimens from 12 coronary
	artery lesions that caused lethal myocardial infarction were compared
	with those from 12 stable control lesions. A finite element model
	was used to calculate the stress distributions at a mean intraluminal
	pressure of 110 mm Hg. The maximum circumferential stress in plaques
	that ruptured was significantly higher than maximum stress in stable
	specimens (4,091 +/- 1,199 versus 1,444 +/- 485 mm Hg, p < 0.0001).
	Twelve of 12 ruptured lesions had a total of 31 regions of stress
	concentration of more than 2,250 mm Hg (mean, 2.6 +/- 1.4 high stress
	regions per lesion); only one of 12 control lesions had a single
	stress concentration region of more than 2,250 mm Hg. In seven of
	12 lethal lesions (58\%), rupture occurred in the region of maximum
	circumferential stress; in 10 of the 12 lethal lesions (83\%), rupture
	occurred in a region where computed stress was more than 2,250 mm
	Hg. CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest that concentrations of circumferential
	tensile stress in the atherosclerotic plaque may play an important
	role in plaque rupture and myocardial infarction. However, plaque
	rupture may not always occur at the region of highest stress, suggesting
	that local variations in plaque material properties contribute to

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate contrast-enhanced
	ultrasound imaging of carotid atherosclerosis as a clinical tool
	to study intraplaque neovascularization. BACKGROUND: Plaque neovascularization
	is associated with plaque vulnerability and symptomatic disease;
	therefore, imaging of neovascularization in carotid atherosclerosis
	may represent a useful tool for clinical risk stratification and
	monitoring the efficacy of antiatherosclerotic therapies. METHODS:
	Thirty-two patients with 52 carotid plaques were studied by standard
	and contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging. In 17 of these patients
	who underwent endarterectomy, the surgical specimen was available
	for histological determination of microvessel density by CD31/CD34
	double staining. Plaque echogenicity and degree of stenosis at standard
	ultrasound imaging were evaluated for each lesion. Contrast-agent
	enhancement within the plaque was categorized as absent/peripheral
	(grade 1) and extensive/internal (grade 2). RESULTS: In the surgical
	subgroup, plaques with higher contrast-agent enhancement showed a
	greater neovascularization at histology (grade 2 vs. grade 1 contrast-agent
	enhancement: median vasa vasorum density: 3.24/mm(2) vs. 1.82/mm(2),
	respectively, p = 0.005). In the whole series of 52 lesions, echolucent
	plaques showed a higher degree of contrast-agent enhancement (p <
	0.001). Stenosis degree was not associated with neovascularization
	at histology or with the grade of contrast-agent enhancement. CONCLUSIONS:
	Carotid plaque contrast-agent enhancement with sonographic agents
	correlates with histological density of neovessels and is associated
	with plaque echolucency, a well-accepted marker of high risk lesions,
	but it is unrelated to the degree of stenosis. Contrast-enhanced
	carotid ultrasound imaging may provide valuable information for plaque
	risk stratification and for assessing the response to antiatherosclerotic
	therapies, beyond that provided by standard ultrasound imaging.},

	of magnetic resonance (MR) to detect arterial thrombotic obstruction
	and define thrombus age. BACKGROUND; Arterial thrombi underlie the
	clinical consequences of atherosclerosis and are not reliably detected
	by current noninvasive diagnostic techniques. METHODS: Carotid thrombi
	were induced in swine (n = 7) by arterial injury. Serial high-resolution
	in vivo MR images were obtained using black-blood T1-weighted (T1W)
	and T2-weighted (T2W) sequences in a clinical 1.5T MR system at 6
	h, 1 day and at 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9 weeks. At each time point one animal
	was sacrificed and the occluded carotid artery processed for histopathology.
	Thrombus signal intensity (SI) was normalized to that of the adjacent
	muscle. Thrombus age was assessed based on MR appearance by two blinded
	independent observers. RESULTS: Thrombus appearance and relative
	SI revealed characteristic temporal changes in multicontrast-weighted
	MR images, reflecting histologic changes in the composition. Acute
	thrombus appeared very bright on the T2W images, facilitating the
	detection. Signal intensity was 197 +/- 25\% at 6 h, peaking at 1
	week (246 +/- 51\%), reaching a plateau by 6 weeks (120 +/- 15\%).
	At six weeks, complete thrombus organization was confirmed histologically.
	The T1W images had similar pattern with lower SI than T2W. Age definition
	using visual appearance was highly accurate (Pearson's chi-square
	with 4 df ranging from 96 to 132 and Cohen's kappa at 0.81 to 0.94).
	Agreement between observers was substantial (Pearson chi-square with
	4 df = 91.5, kappa = 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging
	is a promising tool to noninvasively detect arterial thrombosis.
	Measurement of SI and the characteristic visual appearance of the
	thrombus have the potential to define thrombus age.},

	was measured as a percentage of the total cross sectional area of
	the plaque. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify cell types
	(monocytes/macrophages (M phi) by EBM11 and HAM56, smooth muscle
	cells by alpha actin). The area of the tissue occupied by each cell
	type was measured by quantitative microscopy in the peripheral (shoulder)
	area of the plaque and the plaque cap. Absolute counts of each cell
	type were expressed as the ratio of SMC:M phi. MATERIAL--Aortas were
	obtained at necropsy from men aged less than 69 years who died suddenly
	(within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms) of ischaemic heart disease.
	155 plaques from 13 aortas were studied. Four aortas showed intact
	plaques only (group A, n = 31). Nine aortas showed both intact plaques
	(group B, n = 79) and plaques that were undergoing thrombosis (group
	C, n = 45). RESULTS--In 41 (91.1\%) of the 45 plaques undergoing
	thrombosis (group C) lipid pools occupied more than 40\% of the cross
	sectional area of the plaque. Only 12 (10.9\%) of the 110 intact
	plaques (groups A + B) had lipid pools of this size. The mean size
	of the lipid pool in plaques of groups A, B, and C was 12.7\%, 27.3\%
	and 56.7\% respectively. Compared with intact plaques those undergoing
	thrombosis contained a smaller volume of smooth muscle cells (2.8\%

	in the plaque cap. The ratio of the number of smooth muscle cells
	to monocytes/macrophages was 7.8 in group A plaques, 4.1 in group
	B plaques, and 1.0 in group C plaques. This gradient was the result
	of an absolute increase in monocyte/macrophages and an absolute decrease
	in smooth muscle cells. CONCLUSIONS--In the aorta ulceration and
	thrombosis were characteristic of plaques with a high proportion
	of their volume occupied by extracellular lipid, and in which there
	was a shift toward a preponderance of monocyte/macrophages compared

	Data set were used to estimate the association of age with B-mode
	ultrasound common carotid artery diameter for three atherosclerosis
	risk levels. Based on information from clinical examinations, B-mode
	ultrasounds, questionnaires, blood and other tests, participants
	were categorized into three groups: pre-existing disease (prevalent

	body mass index > or = 30, current smoking, or hyperlipidemia), and
	a low risk group (no pre-existing disease, no plaques/shadowing,
	and no major elevated risk factors). Multivariable linear regression
	analyses modeled the common carotid artery diameter relationship
	with age. RESULTS: Age was positively and significantly associated
	with common carotid artery diameter after risk factor adjustment
	in the overall sample, but age had a larger effect among persons
	with evidence of atherosclerosis (interaction p < 0.05). Each year
	of older age was associated with 0.03 mm larger diameter/year among
	persons with pre-existing disease, with 0.027 mm larger diameter/year
	in the high risk group, but only 0.017 mm/year among the low risk
	group. Results were qualitatively similar using plaques/shadowing
	status to indicate atherosclerosis severity. CONCLUSION: The significant
	impact of age on common carotid artery diameter among low risk, middle-aged,
	black and white men and women suggests arterial remodelling may occur
	in the absence of identified risk factors. The significantly larger
	impact of age among persons with, compared to persons without identified

	the geometry at baseline was used for shear stress calculation using
	computational fluid dynamics. Correlation of the change in plaque
	composition with the shear stress at baseline showed that the ulcer

  abstract = {The aim of this review is to summarize present knowledge of the ultrasonic
	detection and determinants of carotid atherosclerosis with lipid-rich
	cores and to review the evidence that these measures of plaque type
	may predict cerebral events. With the use of high-resolution ultrasound
	B-mode imaging, carotid plaques evaluated as only weakly reflecting
	the ultrasound beam (echolucent) have been associated with a higher
	risk of neurological events than are plaques reflecting the ultrasound
	signal strongly (echorich). Histologically, these echolucent plaques
	have a higher content of lipid and hemorrhage than do echorich plaques,
	which contain more calcification and fibrous tissue. Findings in
	the coronary arteries indicate that a lipid-rich plaque with a thin,
	fibrous cap is more vulnerable, is more prone to rupture, and cause
	symptoms compared with fibrous plaques. A search for determinants
	in the blood for these vulnerable plaques suggests that low density
	lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is the best lipid predictor for the
	extent of atherosclerosis, whereas triglyceride-rich lipoproteins
	in particular seem to predict an echolucent plaque. Lowering of LDL
	cholesterol and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in plasma is associated
	with reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis and coronary
	events. LDL cholesterol reduction is also associated with a reduced
	stroke rate. These improvements in the prognosis are thought to be
	the result of a reduction in the lipid content of the plaques, making
	them more stable and resistant to rupture rather than an actual reduction
	in plaque volume and degree of stenosis. In conclusion, it appears
	that ultrasound B-mode imaging as well as lipoproteins presumably
	may predict dangerous and rupture-prone, lipid-rich plaques in the
	carotid arteries, thereby being potential diagnostic tools in the
	prevention of neurological events.},

	histology. DESIGN: European multicentre study (nine centres). MATERIAL
	AND METHODS: Clinical presentation and risk factors were recorded
	and preoperative ultrasound Duplex scanning with special emphasis
	on B-mode imaging studies was performed in 270 patients undergoing
	carotid endarterectomy. Perioperatively, macroscopic plaque features
	were evaluated and the removed specimens were analysed histologically
	for fibrous tissue, calcification and 'soft tissue' (primarily haemorrhage
	and lipid). RESULTS: Males had more soft tissue than females (p =
	0.0006), hypertensive patients less soft tissue than normotensive
	(p = 0.01) and patients with recent symptoms more soft tissue than
	patients with earlier symptoms (p = 0.004). There was no correlation
	between surface description on ultrasound images compared to the
	surface judged intraoperatively by the surgeon. Echogenicity on B-mode
	images was inversely related to soft tissue (p = 0.005) and calcification
	was directly related to echogenicity (p < 0.0001). Heterogeneous
	plaques contained more calcification than homogeneous (p = 0.003),
	however, there was no difference in content of soft tissue. CONCLUSION:
	Ultrasound B-mode characteristics are related to the histological
	composition of carotid artery plaques and to patient's history. These
	results may imply that patients with distant symptoms may be regarded
	and treated as asymptomatic patients whereas asymptomatic patients
	with echolucent plaques should be considered for carotid endarterectomy.},

	can be used to determine carotid plaque composition and that specific
	plaque characteristics are associated with a worse clinical outcome.
	However, histological studies examining the relationship between
	carotid plaque morphology and clinical outcome have reported conflicting
	findings. Furthermore, few investigators have described plaque morphology
	in quantifiable terms. This study examines the association between
	the volume of carotid plaque constituents and preoperative ischemic
	neurological symptoms. Constituents examined were chosen based on
	their potential for identification by current diagnostic imaging
	modalities such as ultrasound or MRI. METHODS: Atherosclerotic plaques
	from 43 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were examined
	histologically, with sections obtained every 0.5 to 1 mm. The lesions
	were examined for the presence and quantity of fibrous intimal tissue,
	intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid core, necrotic plaque core, and calcification.
	The quantity of each constituent was compared in plaques removed
	from symptomatic patients with those excised from asymptomatic individuals.
	Differences were analyzed with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. RESULTS:
	There was no difference between plaques removed from asymptomatic
	and symptomatic patients with regard to the presence and volume of
	fibrous intimal tissue, intraplaque hemorrhage, the lipid core, the
	necrotic core, or calcification. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with highly
	stenotic carotid lesions who are undergoing carotid endarterectomy,
	gross plaque composition is similar regardless of preoperative symptom
	status. Given this similarity, it is unlikely that differences in
	the volume of intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid core, necrotic core,
	or calcification in atherosclerotic carotid plaques explain their

	the local determinants of in-plaque longitudinal stress distribution
	along the coronary arterial wall remain unclear. METHODS Using a
	finite element analysis, we performed a color mapping of equivalent
	stress distribution within plaques for three-dimensional vessel models
	as well as longitudinal IVUS plaque images (n = 15). Then, the effects
	of plaque size, shape, expansive remodeling, calcification, and lipid
	core on the equivalent stress distribution were examined. RESULTS
	The color mapping of vessel models revealed a concentration of equivalent
	stress at the top of the hills and the shoulders of homogeneous fibrous
	plaques. Expansive remodeling and the lipid core augmented the surface
	equivalent stress, whereas luminal stenosis and superficial calcification
	attenuated the equivalent stress. The location of excessive stress
	concentration was modified by the distribution of the lipid core
	and calcification. The thickness of the fibrous cap was inversely
	related to the equivalent stress within the fibrous cap. However,
	the color mapping of IVUS plaque images showed that the equivalent
	stress value at the fibrous cap varied with changes in plaque shape
	and superficial calcification, even when the thickness of the fibrous
	cap remained constant. CONCLUSIONS A distribution analysis of longitudinal
	stress revealed specific effects of plaque shape, size, and remodeling,
	as well as effects of the interior distribution of tissue components,
	on the concentration of stress at the plaque surface. Moreover, fibrous
	caps of the same thickness did not consistently represent the same
	vulnerability to rupture.},

	of tissue surrounding atherosclerotic plaque in which a novel phased

	By comparing the pathological findings with the distribution of elasticity,
	average elasticity of lipid and that of a mixture of smooth muscle
	and collagen fiber can be determined. On the basis of these reference
	parameters, each point is statistically categorized as lipid, mixture,
	or other. Thus, the plaque is electronically stained using transcutaneous

	the presence of thin collagen fiber was clarified along the arterial
	axis for normal subjects, whereas soft inclusion of lipid was found
	for every plaque in subjects with hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSIONS: This

	Thirty-two patients (22 men, 10 women; mean age, 75 years) with plaques
	of the internal carotid artery as identified by high-resolution B-mode
	scanning were investigated with real-time compound ultrasound imaging
	with the use of a 5- to 12-MHz dynamic range linear transducer on
	a duplex scanner. Two independent observers rated plaque morphology
	according to a standardized protocol. RESULTS: The majority of plaques
	was classified as predominantly echogenic and as plaques of irregular
	surface, whereas ulcerated plaques were rarely observed. The interobserver
	agreement for plaque surface characterization was good for both compound
	ultrasound (kappa=0.72) and conventional B-mode (kappa=0.65). For
	the determination of plaque echogenicity, the reproducibility of
	compound ultrasound (kappa(w)=0.83) was even higher than that of
	conventional B-mode ultrasound (kappa(w)=0.74). According to a semiquantitative
	analysis, real-time compound ultrasound was rated superior in the

	Real-time compound ultrasound is a suitable technique for the characterization

  abstract = {Intravascular ultrasound elastography is a method for measuring the
	local elastic properties using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). The
	elastic properties of the different tissues within the atherosclerotic
	plaque are measured through the strain. Knowledge of these elastic
	properties is useful for guiding interventional procedures (balloon
	dilatation, ablation) and detection of the vulnerable plaque. In
	the last decade, several groups have applied elastography intravascularly
	with various levels of success. In this paper, the approaches of
	the different research groups will be discussed. The focus will be
	on our approach to the application of intravascular elastography,
	Elastograms were acquired in vitro and in vivo using the relative
	local displacements between IVUS images acquired at two levels of
	intravascular pressure with a 30 MHz mechanical or a 20 MHz array
	echo catheter. These displacements were estimated from the time shift
	between gated radiofrequency echo signals using cross-correlation
	algorithms with interpolation around the peak. Experiments on gel-based
	phantoms mimicking atherosclerotic vessels demonstrated the capability
	of elastography to identify soft and hard tissues independently of
	the echogenicity contrast. In vitro experiments on human arteries
	have demonstrated the potential of intravascular elastography to
	identify different plaque types based on their mechanical properties.
	These plaques could not be identified using the IVUS image alone.
	In vivo experiments revealed that reproducible elastograms could
	be obtained near end-diastole. Partial validation using the echogram
	was performed. Intravascular elastography provides information that
	is frequently unavailable or inconclusive from the IVUS image and
	which may therefore assist in the diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerotic
	disease.},

	(MMP-9) are markers of high-risk atherosclerotic carotid plaques
	and strong indicators of plaque instability. Use of statins is associated
	with a decreased risk of stroke and reportedly improves stability
	of atherosclerotic plaques, but available data addressing the mechanism
	of this effect are conflicting. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed
	data from 94 consecutive patients with internal carotid artery stenosis
	who underwent carotid endarterectomy. Excised plaques underwent systematic
	quantitative immunohistochemical analysis to determine the percentage
	of macrophage area and the percentage of MMP-9 area. Associations
	between percentage of macrophage area and percentage of MMP-9 area
	and use of statins and cerebrovascular disease were examined by univariate
	and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: We found significantly higher
	values of percentage of macrophage area and of MMP-9 area in recently
	symptomatic (n = 26) compared with asymptomatic (n = 68) internal
	carotid artery stenoses: median (IQR) percentage of macrophage area
	was 2.29 (1.53-4.129) vs 0.53 (0.27-0.96) and percentage of MMP-9
	area was 0.61 (0.36-0.89) vs 0.08 (0.02-0.27; both P < .0005). Patients
	treated with statins (n = 49) showed lower percentage values of macrophage
	area and MMP-9 area than untreated patients: the percentage of macrophage
	area was 0.54 (0.31-1.18) vs 1.03 (0.57-2.08; P = .01) and percentage
	of MMP-9 area was 0.06 (0.02-0.22) vs 0.36 (0.16-0.62; P < .0005).
	These associations between statin treatment and percentages of macrophage
	area and MMP-9 area did not change after controlling for symptomatic
	cerebrovascular disease and the effects of other potential confounders
	in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the value
	of percentage of macrophage area and percentage of MMP-9 area as
	markers of plaque instability and provide further evidence to support
	the hypothesis that statins reduce inflammatory responses and thereby
	stabilize carotid atherosclerotic plaques.},

	is therefore of particular importance. On the basis of large clinical

	stenosis are the main clinical grounds to perform CEA. However, many

	with histologic characteristics of atherosclerotic carotid plaques
	remains ill-defined. The classification of plaques with recently
	reported measures of plaque echogenicity and heterogeneity has been
	unsatisfactory. We used computer-assisted duplex ultrasound (DU)
	scan image analysis to determine echogenicity of specific tissues
	in control subjects. This information was used to quantify each tissue
	in imaged carotid plaques with pixel distribution analysis (PDA).
	These objective observations then were quantitatively compared with
	plaque histology in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Methods:
	We performed standardized DU scanning of healthy tissues in 10 volunteer
	subjects and of 20 carotid artery plaques (7 symptomatic and 13 asymptomatic)
	in 19 patients with carotid stenosis. The plaques underwent histologic
	analysis after carotid endarterectomy. The grayscale intensity ranges
	of blood, lipid, fibromuscular tissue, and calcium were calculated
	in the control subjects. With computer-assisted image analysis, B-mode
	images of plaques were linearly scaled to normalize data. Pixel distribution
	within the images then was analyzed. The grayscale ranges of known
	tissues obtained from control subjects helped define the amount of
	intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid, fibromuscular tissue, and calcium
	within carotid plaque images. This analysis was correlated with tissue
	composition measurements on histologic sections of excised plaques.
	Results: The median grayscale intensity (range) in control subjects
	was 2 (0 to 4) for blood, 12 (8 to 26) for lipid, 53 (41 to 76) for
	muscle, 172 (112 to 196) for fibrous tissue, and 221 (211 to 255)
	for calcium. PDA-derived predictions for blood, lipid, fibromuscular
	tissue, and calcium within carotid plaques correlated significantly
	with the histologic estimates of each tissue respectively (blood:
	P=.012; lipid: P=.0006; fibromuscular: P=.035; and calcium: P=.0001).
	A significantly higher amount of blood and lipid was seen within
	symptomatic plaques compared with asymptomatic ones (P=.0048 and
	P=.026, respectively). Conversely, a larger amount of calcification
	was noted within asymptomatic plaques (P=.0002): Conclusion: Computer-assisted
	PDA of DU scan images accurately quantified intraplaque hemorrhage,
	fibromuscular tissue, calcium, and lipid. Symptomatic plaques had
	lower calcium content but larger amounts of intraplaque hemorrhage
	and lipid. Quantitative PDA may be used to determine carotid plaque
	tissue composition to assist in the identification of symptomatic

	continues to kill more people than any other disease in the Western

	patients is limited. Prediction of atherosclerotic plaque rupture
	may be addressed by MRI of activated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
	a family of enzymes that have been implicated in the vulnerability
	of plaques prone to rupture. This study evaluated the ability of
	the novel gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent P947 to target MMPs
	in atherosclerotic plaques. METHODS AND RESULTS: The affinity of
	P947 toward activated MMPs was demonstrated in vitro. The affinity
	and specificity of P947 toward matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-rich
	plaques was evaluated both in vivo using ApoE-/- mice and ex vivo
	in hyperlipidemic rabbits. Gadolinium content quantification and
	MRI showed a preferential accumulation of P947 in atherosclerotic
	lesions compared with the nontargeted reference compound, Gd-DOTA.
	The ex vivo assay on rabbit plaques revealed a higher uptake of P947.
	Moreover, using human carotid artery endarterectomy specimens, P947
	facilitated discrimination between histologically defined MMP-rich
	and MMP-poor plaques. An in vivo MRI investigation in mice revealed
	that P947 greatly improved the ability to visualize and delineate

	5. Heterogeneous plaques (types 1 and 2) occurred significantly more
	(p less than 0.001) in symptomatic preoperative arteries than in

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rupture of vulnerable atheromatous plaque in the carotid
	and coronary arteries often leads to stroke and heart attack respectively.
	The role of calcium deposition and its contribution to plaque stability
	is controversial. This study uses both an idealized and a patient-specific
	model to evaluate the effect of a calcium deposit on the stress distribution
	within an atheromatous plaque. METHODS: Using a finite-element method,
	structural analysis was performed on an idealized plaque model and
	the location of a calcium deposit within it was varied. In addition
	to the idealized model, in vivo high-resolution MR imaging was performed
	on 3 patients with carotid atheroma and stress distributions were
	generated. The individual plaques were chosen as they had calcium
	at varying locations with respect to the lumen and the fibrous cap.
	RESULTS: The predicted maximum stress was increased by 47.5\% when
	the calcium deposit was located in the thin fibrous cap in the model
	when compared with that in a model without a deposit. The result
	of adding a calcium deposit either to the lipid core or remote from
	the lumen resulted in almost no increase in maximal stress. CONCLUSION:
	Calcification at the thin fibrous cap may result in high stress concentrations,
	ultimately increasing the risk of plaque rupture. Assessing the location
	of calcification may, in the future, aid in the risk stratification
	of patients with carotid stenosis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: More than half of all cerebral ischemic events are the
	result of rupture of extracranial plaques. The clinical determination
	of carotid plaque vulnerability is currently based solely on luminal
	stenosis; however, it has been increasingly suggested that plaque
	morphology and biomechanical stress should also be considered. We
	used finite element analysis based on in vivo magnetic resonance
	imaging (MRI) to simulate the stress distributions within plaques
	of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. METHODS: Thirty non-consecutive
	subjects (15 symptomatic and 15 asymptomatic) underwent high-resolution
	multisequence in vivo MRI of the carotid bifurcation. Stress analysis
	was performed based on the geometry derived from in vivo MRI of the
	carotid artery at the point of maximal stenosis. The finite element
	analysis model considered plaque components to be hyperelastic. The
	peak stresses within the plaques of symptomatic and asymptomatic
	individuals were compared. RESULTS: High stress concentrations were
	found at the shoulder regions of symptomatic plaques, and the maximal
	stresses predicted in this group were significantly higher than those
	in the asymptomatic group (508.2 +/- 193.1 vs 269.6 +/- 107.9 kPa;
	P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Maximal predicted plaque stresses in symptomatic
	patients were higher than those predicted in asymptomatic patients
	by finite element analysis, suggesting the possibility that plaques
	with higher stresses may be more prone to be symptomatic and rupture.
	If further validated by large-scale longitudinal studies, biomechanical
	stress analysis based on high resolution in vivo MRI could potentially
	act as a useful tool for risk assessment of carotid atheroma. It
	may help in the identification of patients with asymptomatic carotid
	atheroma at greatest risk of developing symptoms or mild-to-moderate
	symptomatic stenoses, which currently fall outside current clinical
	guidelines for intervention.},

	a finite element method, structural analysis was performed using
	models derived from in vivo high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging
	(MRI) of carotid atheroma in 40 non-consecutive patients (20 symptomatic,
	20 asymptomatic). Plaque components were modeled as hyper-elastic
	materials. The effects of varying fibrous cap thickness, lipid core
	size and lumen curvature on plaque stress distributions were examined.
	Lumen curvature and fibrous cap thickness were found to be major
	determinants of plaque stress. The size of the lipid core did not
	alter plaque stress significantly when the fibrous cap was relatively
	thick. The correlation between plaque stress and lumen curvature
	was significant for both symptomatic (p=0.01; correlation coefficient:
	0.689) and asymptomatic patients (p=0.01; correlation coefficient:

	larger than those of asymptomatic patients (1.50+/-1.0 mm(-1) vs

	(large lumen curvature and thin fibrous cap) is closely related to

	precedes the onset of clinical syndromes, and studies have implicated
	a role for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in this process. The
	aim of this study was to establish the character, level, and expression
	of MMPs in carotid plaques and to correlate this with clinical status,
	cerebral embolization, and histology. METHODS: Plaques were obtained
	from 75 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and
	divided into 4 groups according to symptomatology (group 1, asymptomatic;
	group 2, symptomatic >6 months before surgery; group 3, symptomatic
	within 1 to 6 months; group 4, symptomatic within 1 month). All patients
	underwent preoperative and intraoperative transcranial Doppler monitoring.
	Plaques were subjected to histological examination and quantification
	of MMPs by zymography and ELISA. RESULTS: The level of MMP-9 was
	significantly higher in group 4 (median 125.7 ng/mL for group 4,
	median <32 ng/mL for all other groups; P=0.003), with no difference
	in the levels of MMPs 1, 2, or 3. Furthermore, the MMP-9 concentration
	was significantly higher in plaques undergoing spontaneous embolization
	(P=0.019) and those with histological evidence of plaque instability
	(P<0.03). In situ hybridization demonstrated increased MMP-9 expression
	in highly symptomatic plaques in areas of intense inflammatory infiltrate.
	CONCLUSIONS: The concentration, production, and expression of MMP-9
	is significantly higher in unstable carotid plaques. If this proves
	to be a causal relationship, MMP-9 may be a strong candidate for
	pharmacotherapy aimed at stabilizing plaques and preventing stroke.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Plaque rupture is the principal cause of acute coronary
	ischaemia, and unstable carotid plaques are associated with a high
	risk of ischaemic stroke. Carotid plaque ulceration also predicts
	acute coronary events, suggesting that systemic factors may determine
	plaque instability. One potentially important factor is pulse pressure.
	There is indirect evidence that cyclical haemodynamic forces affect
	plaque stability, and pulse pressure is a strong predictor of coronary
	events. OBJECTIVE: To study the association between pulse pressure
	and plaque ulceration. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied angiograms
	from 3007 patients with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis in
	the European Carotid Surgery Trial. Presence of ulceration was related
	to the different components of blood pressure [pulse pressure, systolic
	blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic
	blood pressure (DBP)], and adjustment was made for age, sex, diabetes,
	smoking, and the degree of vessel stenosis. RESULTS: Pulse pressure
	was the strongest independent predictor of ulceration of the symptomatic
	carotid plaque [adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the upper compared with
	the lower quintile 2.07, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.25 to 3.44;
	P = 0.004]. This relationship was weaker for SBP (OR 1.66, 95\% CI

	to characterize mechanical properties of superficial arteries. In
	this paper, the feasibility of NIVE and its applicability in the

	experiments were performed in vitro on vessel-mimicking phantoms.
	Polyvinyl alcohol cryogel was used to create two double-layer vessels
	with different mechanical properties. In both cases, the stiffness
	of the inner layer was made softer. Radial stress was applied within
	the lumen of the phantoms by applying incremental static pressure
	steps with a column of a flowing mixture of water-glycerol. The vessel
	phantoms were insonified at 32 MHz with an ultrasound biomicroscope
	to provide cross-section sequences of radio-frequency (RF) ultrasound
	data. The Lagrangian speckle model estimator (LSME) was used to assess
	the two-dimensional-strain tensors, and the composite Von Mises elastograms
	were computed. A new implementation of the LSME based on the optical
	flow equations was introduced. Deformation parameters were estimated
	using an inversion algorithm. For each in vitro experiment, both
	layers of approximately I rum were distinguished. Second, the use
	of the method for the purpose of studying small vessels (MicroNIVE)
	in genetically engineered rodents was introduced. Longitudinal scans
	of the carotid artery were performed at 40 MHz. The in vivo results

  abstract = {Plaque rupture is correlated with the plaque morphology, composition,
	mechanical properties, and with the blood pressure. Whereas the geometry
	can accurately be assessed with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging,
	intravascular elastography (IVE) is capable of extracting information
	on the plaque local mechanical properties and composition. This paper
	reports additional IVE validation data regarding reproducibility
	and potential to characterize atherosclerotic plaques and mural thrombi.
	In a first investigation, radio frequency (RF) data were acquired
	from the abdominal aorta of an atherosclerotic rabbit model. In a
	second investigation, IVUS RF data were recorded from the left coronary
	artery of a patient referred for angioplasty. In both cases, Galaxy
	IVUS scanners (Boston Scientific, Freemont, CA), equipped with 40
	MHz Atlantis catheters, were used. Elastograms were computed using
	two methods, the Lagrangian speckle model estimator (LSME) and the
	scaling factor estimator (SFE). Corroborated with histology, the
	LSME and the SFE both clearly detected a soft thrombus attached to
	the vascular wall. Moreover, shear elastograms, only available with
	the LSME, confirmed the presence of the thrombus. Additionally, IVE
	was found reproducible with consistent elastograms between cardiac
	cycles (CCs). Regarding the human dataset, only the LSME was capable
	of identifying a plaque that presumably sheltered a lipid core. Whereas
	such an assumption could not be certified with histology, radial
	shear and tangential strain LSME elastograms enabled the same conclusion.
	It is worth emphasizing that this paper reports the first ever in
	vivo tangential strain elastogram with regards to vascular imaging,
	due to the LSME. It is concluded that the IVE was reproducible exhibiting
	consistent strain patterns between CCs. The IVE might provide a unique

  abstract = {Changes in vessel wall elasticity may be indicative of vessel pathologies.
	It is known, for example, that the presence of plaque stiffens the
	vascular wall, and that the heterogeneity of its composition may
	lead to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Another domain of application
	where ultrasound elastography may be of interest is the study of
	vascular wall elasticity to predict the risk of aneurysmal tissue
	rupture. In this paper, this technology is introduced as an approach
	to noninvasively characterize superficial arteries. In such a case,
	a linear array ultrasound transducer is applied on the skin over
	the region of interest, and the arterial tissue is dilated by the
	normal cardiac pulsation. The elastograms, the equivalent elasticity
	images, are computed from the assessment of the vascular tissue motion.
	Investigating the forward problem, it is shown that motion parameters
	might be difficult to interpret; that is because tissue motion occurs
	radially within the vessel wall while the ultrasound beam propagates
	axially. As a consequence of that, the elastograms are subjected
	to hardening and softening artefacts, which are to be counteracted.
	In this paper, the Von Mises (VM) coefficient is proposed as a new
	parameter to circumvent such mechanical artefacts and to appropriately
	characterize the vessel wall. Regarding the motion assessment, the
	Lagrangian estimator was used; that is because it provides the full
	two-dimensional strain tensor necessary to compute the VM coefficient.
	The theoretical model was validated with biomechanical simulations
	of the vascular wall properties. The results allow believing in the
	potential of the method to differentiate hard plaques and lipid pools
	from normal vascular tissue. Potential in vivo implementation of
	noninvasive vascular elastography to characterize abdominal aneurysms
	and superficial arteries such as the femoral and the carotid is discussed.},

	fracture mechanics suggest that analysis of local variations in surface
	deformability may provide information on relative vulnerability to
	plaque fissuring or rupture. We investigated plaque surface deformations
	in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery disease
	using 4-dimensional ultrasonography and techniques for measuring
	optical flow. METHODS: Four-dimensional ultrasound examinations of
	carotid artery plaques were performed in 23 asymptomatic and 22 symptomatic
	patients with 50\% to 90\% stenosis of the internal carotid artery.
	Plaque surface motion during 1 cardiac cycle was computed with a
	hierarchical model-based motion estimator. Results were compared
	with plaque echogenicity and surface structure. RESULTS: Of the 45
	patients examined, plaque surface motion estimates were obtained
	for 18 asymptomatic and 13 symptomatic patients. There were no significant
	differences in echogenicity or surface structure of asymptomatic
	and symptomatic plaques (P>0.05). Results of motion estimation showed
	that asymptomatic plaques had surface motion vectors of equal orientation
	and magnitude to those of the internal carotid artery, whereas symptomatic
	plaques demonstrated evidence of inherent plaque movement. There
	was no significant difference in maximal plaque velocity between
	symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques (P<0.14). Maximal discrepant
	surface velocity (MDSV) in symptomatic plaques was 3.85+/-1.26 mm/s
	(mean+/-SD), which was significantly higher (P<0.001) than MDSV of
	asymptomatic plaques with 0.58+/-0.42 mm/s (mean+/-SD). CONCLUSIONS:
	++MDSV of carotid artery plaques is significantly different in asymptomatic
	and symptomatic disease. Further studies are warranted to determine
	whether plaque surface motion patterns can identify vulnerable plaques

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thromboembolic disease secondary to complicated carotid
	atherosclerotic plaque is a major cause of cerebral ischemia. Clinical
	management relies on the detection of significant (>70\%) carotid
	stenosis. A large proportion of patients suffer irreversible cerebral
	ischemia as a result of lesser degrees of stenosis. Diagnostic techniques
	that can identify nonstenotic high-risk plaque would therefore be
	beneficial. High-risk plaque is defined histologically if it contains
	hemorrhage/thrombus. Magnetic resonance direct thrombus imaging (MRDTI)
	is capable of detecting methemoglobin within intraplaque hemorrhage.
	We assessed this as a marker of complicated plaque and compared its
	accuracy with histological examination of surgical endarterectomy
	specimens. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-three patients underwent successful
	MRDTI and endarterectomy with histological examination. Of these,
	44 were histologically defined as complicated (type VI plaque). MRDTI
	demonstrated 3 false-positive and 7 false-negative results, giving
	a sensitivity and specificity of 84\%, negative predictive value
	of 70\%, and positive predictive value of 93\%. The interobserver
	(kappa=0.75) and intraobserver (kappa=0.9) agreement for reading

	patients with cerebral ischemia is an accurate means of identifying

	making this technique highly applicable in the research and clinical

	the mid-1980s, then declined. Our investigation sought to determine
	whether carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of stroke among patients
	with a recent adverse cerebrovascular event and ipsilateral carotid
	stenosis. METHODS. We conducted a randomized trial at 50 clinical
	centers throughout the United States and Canada, in patients in two
	predetermined strata based on the severity of carotid stenosis--30
	to 69 percent and 70 to 99 percent. We report here the results in
	the 659 patients in the latter stratum, who had had a hemispheric
	or retinal transient ischemic attack or a nondisabling stroke within
	the 120 days before entry and had stenosis of 70 to 99 percent in
	the symptomatic carotid artery. All patients received optimal medical
	care, including antiplatelet therapy. Those assigned to surgical
	treatment underwent carotid endarterectomy performed by neurosurgeons
	or vascular surgeons. All patients were examined by neurologists
	1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after entry and then every 4 months. End
	points were assessed by blinded, independent case review. No patient
	was lost to follow-up. RESULTS. Life-table estimates of the cumulative
	risk of any ipsilateral stroke at two years were 26 percent in the
	331 medical patients and 9 percent in the 328 surgical patients--an
	absolute risk reduction (+/- SE) 17 +/- 3.5 percent (P less than
	0.001). For a major or fatal ipsilateral stroke, the corresponding
	estimates were 13.1 percent and 2.5 percent--an absolute risk reduction
	of 10.6 +/- 2.6 percent (P less than 0.001). Carotid endarterectomy
	was still found to be beneficial when all strokes and deaths were
	included in the analysis (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Carotid

	classification (the size and site of the infarct) as one of the following:
	total anterior circulation infarcts (TACIs); partial anterior circulation

	10 (14\%) were classified as TACIs, 34 (45\%) as PACIs, 12 (16\%)

	that can be used for the quantitative analysis of risk for embolization
	associated with balloon angioplasty and stenting and to correlate
	this risk with lesion characteristics to define lesions suitable

	plaque (n = 24) were obtained circumferentially intact from patients
	undergoing standard carotid endarterectomy. Carotid lesions were
	prospectively characterized on the basis of angiographic and duplex
	findings before endarterectomy and clinical findings. Specimens were
	encased in a polytetrafluoroethylene wrap and mounted in a flow chamber
	that allowed access for endovascular procedures and observations.
	Balloon angioplasty and stenting were performed under fluoroscopic
	guidance with either a Palmaz stent or a Wallstent endoprosthesis.
	Ex vivo angiograms were obtained before and after intervention. Effluent
	from each specimen was filtered for released embolic particles, which
	were microscopically examined, counted, and correlated with various
	plaque characteristics by means of multivariate analysis. RESULTS:
	Balloon angioplasty and stenting produced embolic particles that
	consisted of atherosclerotic debris, organized thrombus, and calcified
	material. The number of embolic particles detected after balloon
	angioplasty and stenting was not related to preoperative symptoms,
	sex, plaque ulceration or calcification, or artery size. However,
	echolucent plaques generated a higher number of particles compared
	with echogenic plaques (p < 0.01). In addition, increased lesion
	stenosis also significantly correlated with the total number of particles
	produced by balloon angioplasty and stenting (r = 0.55). Multivariate
	analysis revealed that these two characteristics were independent
	risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Echolucent plaques and plaques with stenosis
	> or = 90\% produced a higher number of embolic particles and therefore
	may be less suitable for balloon angioplasty and stenting. This ex

	morphology with the patient's presenting symptoms has drawn conflicting
	conclusions. The purpose of this series was to correlate carotid
	plaque characteristics with the presenting symptoms from a large
	cohort of patients who underwent operation for carotid artery disease.
	METHODS: From a series of 1252 consecutive patients who underwent
	carotid endarterectomy, presenting symptoms were divided into three
	groups: transiently symptomatic (transient ischemic attack [TIA]
	or amaurosis fugax), prior stroke, and asymptomatic. Plaque characteristics,
	including ulceration, intraplaque hemorrhage, and degree of stenosis,
	were recorded prospectively for 1008 procedures. All endarterectomy
	specimens were inspected during the procedure, and plaque characteristics
	were recorded immediately after operation. RESULTS: There was a higher
	incidence of plaque ulceration in the transiently symptomatic and
	prior stroke groups (391 of 508 [77\%] and 91 of 115 [79\%]) than
	in the asymptomatic cohort (231 of 385 [60\%]; p < 0.0001, chi2 test).
	There was no significant difference in the incidence of plaque hemorrhage
	between the transiently symptomatic and prior stroke patients compared
	with the asymptomatic patients. There was no statistical difference
	for ulcerated plaque or plaque hemorrhage between the transiently
	symptomatic and prior stroke group. Intraplaque hemorrhage occurred
	more frequently in patients with high-grade stenosis (90\% to 99\%)
	than in those with less than 90\% stenosis (202 of 299 [68\%] versus
	97 of 299 [32\%]; p = 0.01, chi2 test). CONCLUSIONS: On gross examination
	of the carotid specimen in the operating room, plaque ulceration
	correlates with an initial presentation of amaurosis fugax, TIA,
	or prior stroke compared with patients operated on for asymptomatic
	disease. The presence of intraplaque hemorrhage is associated with
	more advanced stenosis of the internal carotid artery. These findings
	suggest that plaque morphology does play an important role in the

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: to correlate the echostructural characteristics of carotid
	plaques with neurological symptoms and cerebral infarcts. MATERIALS:
	one hundred and five plaques were studied in 74 patients by colour-flow
	duplex ultrasound: 39 were symptomatic and 37 were associated with
	brain infarction on CT scanning. METHODS: the images were digitalised
	for computer-assisted image standardisation and divided in homogenous
	(n=67) and heterogenous (n=38) groups. Parameters of the plaque image
	were analysed. RESULTS: global echogenicity was significantly lower
	in symptomatic and in CT(+)plaques (p<0.05). For homogenous plaques,
	an echogenic cap (EC) was visualised in 8.3\% of symptomatic vs.
	33.9\% of asymptomatic (p<0. 05) and in 7.7\% for plaques that were
	CT(+)vs. 37.7\% for CT(-)(p<0. 05). Surface disruption was visualised
	in 50\% of symptomatic vs. 8. 5\% of asymptomatic (p=0.002) and in
	46\% of CT(+)vs. 9.4\% of CT(-)plaques (p=0.002). For heterogenous
	plaques, the echolucent region was juxtaluminal in 67\% of symptomatic
	and CT(+)plaques vs. 33\% in asymptomatic and CT(-)(p<0.01). CONCLUSION:
	echolucent plaques are associated with a higher neurological risk.
	In homogenous plaques the absence of an echogenic cap and disruption
	of the plaque surface also correlates with symptoms. In heterogenous
	plaques, juxtaluminal location of the echolucent region is an additional
	marker of increased risk.},

	at baseline, were 65 years of age or older and without symptoms of
	cerebrovascular disease was followed up for an average of 3.3 years.
	Baseline clinical findings were from color Doppler and duplex US
	studies of the carotid arteries and a record of traditional risk
	factors: age, sex, presence of diabetes mellitus, pack-years of cigarette
	smoking, presence of hypertension, elevated systolic and diastolic
	blood pressure, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level.
	RESULTS: Incident strokes, excluding hemorrhagic strokes and strokes
	of cardiac origin, were seen in 104 individuals (2.1\%) at risk.
	Age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios for incident stroke were significant
	for hypoechoic plaque (odds ratio, 2.53; 95\% CI, 1,42,4.53). After
	controlling for risk factors in a Cox proportional hazards model,
	the relative risk (RR) of incident stroke was 1.72 (p = .015) for
	hypoechoic plaque and 2.32 (P = .004) for internal carotid arterial
	narrowing of at least 50\%. In addition, hypoechoic plaque (RR, 2.78;

	extracranial carotid plaque surface irregularity and ischemic stroke.
	Using a prospective cohort design, we evaluated the association of
	carotid plaque surface irregularity and the risk of ischemic stroke
	in a multiethnic population. METHODS: High-resolution B-mode ultrasound
	of the carotid arteries was performed in 1939 stroke-free subjects
	(mean age 69+/-10.0 years; 59\% women; 53\% Hispanic, 25\% black,
	22\% white). Plaque was defined as a focal protrusion 50\% greater
	than the surrounding area and localized along the extracranial carotid
	tree (internal carotid artery/bifurcation vs common carotid artery).
	Plaque surface was categorized as regular or irregular. Cox proportional
	hazard models were used to assess the association of surface characteristics
	and the risk of ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Among 1939 total subjects,
	carotid plaque was visualized in 56.3\% (1 plaque: 21.6\%, >1 plaque:
	34.7\%, irregular plaque: 5.5\%). During a mean follow up of 6.2
	years after ultrasound examination, 69 ischemic strokes occurred.
	Unadjusted cumulative 5-year risks of ischemic stroke were: 1.3\%,
	3.0\%, and 8.5\% for no plaque, regular plaque, and irregular plaque,
	respectively. After adjusting for demographics, traditional vascular
	risk factors, degree of stenosis, and plaque thickness, presence
	of irregular plaque (vs no plaque) was independently associated with
	ischemic stroke (Hazard ratio, 3.1; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 8.5). CONCLUSIONS:
	The presence of irregular carotid plaque independently predicted
	ischemic stroke in a multiethnic cohort. Plaque surface irregularities
	assessed by B-mode ultrasonography may help identify intermediate-
	to high-risk individuals beyond their vascular risk assessed by the
	presence of traditional risk factors.},

	World. Atherosclerosis of the carotid artery is the most important
	predictor of stroke. Elastography is a technique to assess the composition
	and vulnerability of an atherosclerotic plaque. Contrary to intravascular
	applications, the ultrasound beam and radial strain are not aligned
	in noninvasive acquisitions. In this study, 2D displacement and strain
	images were determined and used to calculate the radial and circumferential
	strain. Rf-data were acquired using a Philips SONOS 7500 live 3D
	ultrasound system, equipped with an 11_3L (3 to 11 MHz) linear array
	transducer and rf-interface. A homogeneous, hollow cylinder phantom
	[20\% gelatin, 1\% SiC scatterers (10 microM)] was measured in a
	water tank at different intraluminal pressures. In addition, measurements
	in patients (n = 12) were made to evaluate the in vivo applicability
	of the technique. Longitudinal and cross-sectional recordings were
	made, both in phantoms and patients. Strain along the ultrasound
	beam (axial strain) was determined using cross-correlation analysis
	for signal-windows from both the pre- and post-compression data.
	For lateral strain, new ultrasound lines were generated between the
	acquired lines using interpolation. A cross-correlation based search
	algorithm was applied to determine lateral displacement and strain.
	Longitudinal axial strain images in the phantom showed a decreasing
	strain from the lumen- vessel wall interface to the outer region
	that can be described by a 1 over r(2) relationship. The lateral
	strain image showed no strain in this direction indicating a plane
	strain situation. In the cross-sectional view, compression of the
	material in regions at 12 and 6 o'clock was observed, whereas expansion
	was observed in regions at 3 and 9 o'clock. This pattern is in accordance
	with theory, but can only be partly corrected for: in the transition
	regions, zero axial strain was measured. The lateral strain image
	showed a complementary pattern. In patients, low strain was observed
	in nonatherosclerotic artery walls. High and low strain regions were
	found in atherosclerotic plaques. High quality elastograms were generated
	both in longitudinal and cross-sectional views. In conclusion, 2D
	noninvasive elastography of atherosclerotic carotid plaques is feasible.
	Phantom studies revealed elastograms in accordance with theory. Additional
	in vivo validation is needed to assess the value of this technique
	for identifying plaque vulnerability and composition.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major thrombotic and embolic complications of atherosclerosis
	are closely associated with irregularity and rupture of atheromatous
	plaques in both the carotid and coronary arteries. Plaque instability
	is partly determined by local factors, but systemic factors, such
	as infection, autoimmunity, or genes, may also be important. If plaque
	stability is influenced by systemic factors that are present in only
	a proportion of patients, some individuals should be more prone to
	rupture of plaques than others--ie, irregular plaques should occur
	in multiple vascular beds in some individuals more frequently than
	would be expected by chance alone. METHODS: We studied 5393 carotid
	bifurcation angiograms from 3007 patients with a recently symptomatic
	carotid stenosis. We assessed the extent to which plaque-surface
	irregularity at the symptomatic carotid artery was associated with
	irregularity at a distant site, the contralateral carotid artery,
	and the extent to which plaque irregularity at these sites was associated
	with previous myocardial infarction or subsequent non-stroke vascular
	death (due mainly to coronary-artery disease). FINDINGS: Patients
	with plaque-surface irregularity (n=1897) in the symptomatic carotid
	artery were more likely than those with smooth plaque (n=110) to
	have irregularity in the contralateral carotid artery (odds ratio
	2.21 [95\% CI 1.62-3.01], p<0.001). Patients with irregular plaques
	in both arteries were more likely to have had a previous myocardial
	infarction than patients with smooth plaques (hazard ratio 1.82 [1.23-2.64],
	p<0.001), and were more likely to have a non-stroke vascular death
	on follow-up (hazard ratio 1.67 [1.15-2.44], p=0.007). However, there
	was no difference in the risk of non-vascular death (hazard ratio
	0.92 [0.57-1.45], p=0.5). These associations were not explicable
	on the basis of differences in traditional vascular risk factors.
	INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that some individuals have a systemic
	predisposition to irregularity and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques
	that is independent of traditional vascular risk factors. This finding
	supports the hypothesis that other systemic factors are important
	in the cause of plaque instability.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy lowers the risk of carotid territory
	ipsilateral ischaemic stroke, and is the treatment of choice, in
	patients with recently symptomatic 70-99\% carotid stenosis. However,
	the 3-year risk of stroke on medical treatment alone is only about
	20\%. We investigated whether the efficacy of endarterectomy would
	be improved if patients with a high risk of stroke on medical treatment
	and a low risk of operative stroke or death could be identified.
	METHODS: We developed two prognostic models from data on patients
	with 0-69\% carotid stenosis in the European Carotid Surgery Trial
	(ECST). The medical model predicted risk of ipsilateral carotid territory
	major ischaemic stroke (fatal or lasting longer than 7 days) on medical
	treatment and the surgical model predicted risk of major stroke and
	death within 30 days of endarterectomy. From these models we developed
	a prognostic score to identify patients with a high risk of stroke
	on medical treatment but a low operative risk. We validated the models
	and tested the scoring system on 990 ECST patients with 70-99\% carotid
	stenosis assigned surgery (594) or medical treatment only (396).
	FINDINGS: When patients with 70-99\% stenosis were stratified by
	the scoring system, which was based on seven independent prognostic
	factors, endarterectomy was beneficial in only 162 (16\%) patients.
	The 5-year absolute risk of carotid territory ipsilateral major ischaemic
	stroke, operative major stroke, or death was lowered by 33\% in the
	16\% of patients with a score of 4 or more (odds ratio 0.12 [95\%
	CI 0.05-0.29], p<0.0001), but not in the other 828 (84\%) patients
	(1.00 [0.65-1.54], p=0.7). INTERPRETATION: Many patients with recently
	symptomatic 70-99\% carotid stenosis may not benefit from carotid
	endarterectomy. Validation of the predictive score is needed on external
	datasets, but risk-factor modelling could be useful to identify those
	patients in whom endarterectomy will be beneficial.},

	Eight patients with symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis were imaged

	As a means to prevent cerebrovascular events, current concepts advocate

	disease. Arterial stenosis alone has been shown to be a poor predictor
	of cardiovascular events and therefore both arterial stenosis and
	patient symptom status are taken as indications for interventional
	therapy. Several studies have shown that symptomatic subjects benefit

	carotid endarterectomies in asymptomatic patients with > 50 \% stenosis.

	of luminal stenosis can determine a patient's symptom status, such

	for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The number of patients
	who showed plaque ulcerations increased with the severity of stenosis.
	Furthermore, ulcerations of the carotid plaque occurred more often
	proximal than distal to the point of maximum stenosis, and this trend
	increased with the severity of the stenosis. We also determined that
	fatty plaques were more likely to be affected by ulcerations. CONCLUSIONS:
	The results of our study suggest that MDCTA detects with higher sensitivity
	and specificity the presence of ulcerated plaque compared with US-ECD,
	which has been demonstrated to be less effective in this evaluation.
	Considering the high MDCTA sensitivity and specificity for detection
	of plaque ulceration, we therefore recommend MDCTA as a useful step
	for correct presurgical planning.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Stroke is a leading cause of severe disability in the western
	world. A correct diagnostic procedure to stratify risk is necessary
	in order to rapidly plan the most efficient therapy. The purpose
	of this work was to evaluate the agreement between ultrasound echo-color
	Doppler (US-ECD) and multidetector-row CT angiography (MDCTA) in
	determining the degree of carotid stenosis. Methods and Materials:
	From January 2004 to February 2007, 187 patients who had previously
	undergone both US-ECD and MDCTA were studied retrospectively. For
	each patient, stenosis degree was measured by applying the North
	American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria. Data
	derived from MDCTA and US-ECD were then compared to calculate the
	inter-technique variability by using Cohen kappa statistics. For
	all plaque types (fatty, mixed and calcified), inter-technique variability
	was assessed. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to highlight
	differences between the procedures, and scatterplots were also calculated.
	As a gold standard, reference surgical comparisons were performed
	in 50 patients. Results: The percentage of observed agreements in
	the evaluation of stenosis degree was 72.19\% with a kappa value
	of 0.659 (95\% confidence interval: 0.604-0.715) and a weighted kappa
	of 0.789. After the evaluating stenosis degree in fatty, mixed and
	calcified plaques, the percentages of observed agreements were 79.31,
	74.58 and 64.29\%, respectively, with kappa values of 0.738, 0.691
	and 0.565. Conclusion: A good agreement between US-ECD and MDCTA
	in the evaluation of stenosis degree was observed, together with
	a remarkable difference between the 2 techniques in the assessment
	both of calcified plaques and of plaques showing a predominant calcific
	component.},

	However, the predictive value of intravascular elastography to detect

	coronary arteries were investigated with intravascular elastography
	and subsequently processed for histology. In histology, a vulnerable
	plaque was defined as a plaque consisting of a thin cap (<250 \&mu;m)
	with moderate to heavy macrophage infiltration and at least 40\%
	of atheroma. In elastography, a vulnerable plaque was defined as
	a plaque with a high strain region at the surface with adjacent low
	strain regions. In 24 diseased coronary arteries, we studied 54 cross
	sections. In histology, 26 vulnerable plaques and 28 nonvulnerable
	plaques were found. Receiver operator characteristic analysis revealed
	a maximum predictive power for a strain value threshold of 1.26\%.
	The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.85.
	The sensitivity was 88\%, and the specificity was 89\% to detect

	the strain in caps and the amount of macrophages (P < 0.006) and

	the main cause of acute coronary events. At present it is not known
	specifically how various risk factors influence the development and

	depends more on plaque composition and vulnerability (plaque type)
	than on the degree of stenosis (plaque size). Lipid accumulation
	and chronic inflammation, particularly macrophage activities, seem
	to influence the development and the stability of a plaque and thus
	its propensity to rupture. Macrophages have the ability to secrete
	proteolytic enzymes and often infiltrate the region of imminent plaque
	rupture, and disruption may be associated with a generalized inflammatory
	reaction. Further, plaque disruption tends to occur at points where
	the plaque surface is weakest, corresponding to locations where mechanical
	and hemodynamic forces have their highest impact. The risk of plaque
	disruption is a function of both plaque vulnerability (intrinsic
	disease) and rupture triggers (extrinsic forces). The former predisposes
	the plaque to rupture; the latter may precipitate rupture. The danger
	of vulnerable plaques, however, is not related to disruption as such
	but to the resulting thrombosis. The magnitude of this thrombotic
	response and the ensuing flow obstruction depends on the contents
	and quantity of exposed thrombogenic plaque material, the degree
	of pre-existing stenosis, and the systemic thrombotic tendency. The
	thrombotic response is a dynamic process that is decisive for the

	syndromes and stroke. Therefore, the ability to detect thrombus in
	vivo has a significant clinical implication. Magnetic resonance imaging
	(MRI) has shown promise in noninvasive thrombus detection. However,
	thrombus characterization and age definition remain difficult. We
	sought to evaluate the use of a fibrin-targeted peptide (EP-2104R)
	for MR thrombus detection and to compare this modality with non-contrast-enhanced
	(NCE) MRI and with Gd-DTPA injection at various ages and time points
	after thrombus generation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Carotid artery thrombosis
	was induced by external injury and stasis in 18 rabbits. T1-weighted
	MRI was performed before and after contrast agent injection, within
	6 hours of thrombus induction, at 48 hours, at 1 week, and every
	week up to 8 weeks after injury. Correlation with histopathology
	was performed. The fibrin-targeted contrast agent accurately detected
	all thrombi, regardless of their size, location, and age. Although
	thrombus signal intensity after injection decreased with thrombus
	age (P<0.001), enhancement at 8 weeks was still present. Gd-DTPA
	injection was not associated with an improvement of thrombus detection.
	EP-2104R was superior to both NCE and Gd-DTPA injection (P<0.001).
	Histopathologic examination showed thrombus organization over time.
	Fibrin was gradually replaced by fibrous tissue. A strong correlation
	was found between thrombus enhancement and collagen content of the
	organizing thrombus with time (R=-0.89; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In
	an experimental animal model of carotid thrombosis, we have demonstrated
	the superiority of a fibrin-targeted MR contrast agent for in vivo
	detection of chronic or organized thrombus, compared with NCE MRI

	Temporal sequences of digitized B-mode ultrasound images of the carotid

	could predict plaque histology better than an overall GSM measurement.
	METHODS: Thirty-one carotid plaques derived from 28 patients undergoing
	carotid endarterectomy were investigated by ultrasound. GSMs of the
	whole plaque were used as measurement of echogenicity. A profile
	of the regional GSM as a function of distance from the plaque surface
	could be generated. Plaque pixels were further mapped into 3 different
	colors depending on their GSM value. RESULTS: Plaques with large
	calcifications presented the highest GSM values, and those with large
	hemorrhagic areas or with a predominant necrotic core exhibited the
	lowest. Fibrous plaques had intermediate GSM values. A necrotic core
	located in a juxtalumenal position was associated with significantly
	lower GSM values (P=0.009) and with a predominant red color (GSM
	<50) at the surface (P=0.0019). With respect to the thickness of
	the fibrous cap and the position of the necrotic core, the sensitivity
	and specificity of the predominant red color of the whole plaque

	predominant red color of the surface, the sensitivity and specificity
	increased to 73\% and 67\% and 84\% and 75\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
	The stratified GSM measurement combined with color mapping showed
	a good correlation with the different histopathological components
	and further allowed identification with good accuracy of determinants
	of plaque instability. This approach should be investigated in a

	of stress distributions in plaques reveals that it may be the local

	cap and locations with plaque cap weakness that are more closely
	related to plaque rupture risk. A local maximal stress hypothesis
	and a stress-based computational plaque vulnerability index (CPVI)
	are proposed to assess plaque vulnerability. A critical site selection
	(CSS) method is proposed to identify critical sites in the plaque

	values. Our initial results based on 34 2D MRI slices from 14 human
	coronary plaque samples indicate that CPVI plaque assessment has
	an 85\% agreement rate (91\% if the square root of stress values
	is used) with assessment given by histopathological analysis. Large-scale
	and long-term patient studies are needed to further validate our
	findings for more accurate quantitative plaque vulnerability assessment.},

	variations on critical sites such as a thin cap in the plaque can
	be 300\% higher than that at other normal sites. Large calcification

	variations of plaque components (50\% reduction or 100\% increase)

	properties, and pulsating pressure conditions on stress/strain distributions
	in the plaque are quantified by extensive computational case studies
	and parameter evaluations. Computational mechanical analysis has

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Given the importance of inflammation in atherosclerosis,
	we sought to determine if atherosclerotic plaque inflammation could
	be measured noninvasively in humans using positron emission tomography
	(PET). BACKGROUND: Earlier PET studies using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
	demonstrated increased FDG uptake in atherosclerotic plaques. Here
	we tested the ability of FDG-PET to measure carotid plaque inflammation
	in patients who subsequently underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
	METHODS: Seventeen patients with severe carotid stenoses underwent
	FDG-PET imaging 3 h after FDG administration (13 to 25 mCi), after
	which carotid plaque FDG uptake was determined as the ratio of plaque
	to blood activity (target to background ratio, TBR). Less than 1
	month after imaging, subjects underwent CEA, after which carotid
	specimens were processed to identify macrophages (staining with anti-CD68
	antibodies). RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between
	the PET signal from the carotid plaques and the macrophage staining
	from the corresponding histologic sections (r = 0.70; p < 0.0001).
	When mean FDG uptake (mean TBR) was compared with mean inflammation
	(mean percentage CD68 staining) for each of the 17 patients, the
	correlation was even stronger (r = 0.85; p < 0.0001). Fluorodeoxyglucose
	uptake did not correlate with plaque area, plaque thickness, or area
	of smooth muscle cell staining. CONCLUSIONS: We established that
	FDG-PET imaging can be used to assess the severity of inflammation
	in carotid plaques in patients. If subsequent natural history studies
	link increased FDG-PET activity in carotid arteries with clinical
	events, this noninvasive measure could be used to identify a subset
	of patients with carotid atherosclerosis in need of intensified medical
	therapy or carotid artery intervention to prevent stroke.},

	METHODS: Twenty participants (mean age, 69.8 years [standard deviation]
	+/- 10.5; 75\% men) with 16\%-79\% carotid stenosis at duplex ultrasonography
	were imaged with 1.5-T and 3.0-T MR imaging units with bilateral
	four-element phased-array surface coils. This HIPAA-compliant study
	was approved by the institutional review board, and all participants
	gave written informed consent. Protocols designed for similar signal-to-noise
	ratios across platforms were implemented to acquire axial T1-weighted,
	T2-weighted, intermediate-weighted, time-of-flight, and contrast
	material-enhanced T1-weighted images. Lumen area, wall area, total
	vessel area, wall thickness, and presence or absence and area of
	plaque components were documented. Continuous variables from different
	field strengths were compared by using the intraclass correlation
	coefficient (ICC) and repeated measures analysis. The Cohen kappa
	was used to evaluate agreement between 1.5 T and 3.0 T on compositional
	dichotomous variables. RESULTS: There was a strong level of agreement
	between field strengths for all morphologic variables, with ICCs
	ranging from 0.88 to 0.96. Agreement in the identification of presence
	or absence of plaque components was very good for calcification (kappa
	= 0.72), lipid-rich necrotic core (kappa = 0.73), and hemorrhage
	(kappa = 0.66). However, the visualization of hemorrhage was greater
	at 1.5 T than at 3.0 T (14.7\% vs 7.8\%, P < .001). Calcifications
	measured significantly (P = .03) larger at 3.0 T, while lipid-rich
	necrotic cores without hemorrhage were similar between field strengths
	(P = .9). CONCLUSION: At higher field strengths, the increased susceptibility
	of calcification and paramagnetic ferric iron in hemorrhage may alter
	quantification and/or detection. Nevertheless, imaging criteria at
	1.5 T for carotid vessel wall interpretation are applicable at 3.0
	T.},

	sections were examined histologically at selected levels through
	the distal common and proximal internal carotid arteries. Plaque
	density was measured (in Hounsfield units) on axial CT sections,
	and the presence or absence of ulceration was noted. These observations
	were compared with the histological findings at corresponding levels.
	Data were analyzed with 2-sample t tests and 1-way analysis of variance
	(ANOVA). RESULTS: ANOVA testing showed a statistically significant
	decrease in CT attenuation values with increasing plaque lipid but
	with a very high standard deviation of values. No other histological
	factor showed a statistically significant link with CT attenuation.
	Plaque ulceration was detected by CT with a sensitivity of 60\% and
	a specificity of 74\%. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of plaque attenuation
	with single-slice spiral CT does not give useful information concerning
	plaque composition. The predictive value of CT for the detection
	of plaque ulceration was moderate. Single-slice CT angiography is
	insufficiently robust to be a useful tool for the characterization

	secondary stroke prevention. Non-invasive imaging, now widely available,
	is replacing intra-arterial angiography for carotid stenosis, but
	the accuracy remains uncertain despite an extensive literature. We
	systematically reviewed the accuracy of non-invasive imaging compared
	with intra-arterial angiography for diagnosing carotid stenosis in
	patients with carotid territory ischaemic symptoms.Methods We searched
	for articles published between 1980 and April 2004; included studies
	comparing non-invasive imaging with intra-arterial angiography that
	met Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) criteria;
	extracted data to calculate sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive
	imaging, to test for heterogeneity and to perform sensitivity analyses;
	and categorised percent stenosis by the North American Symptomatic
	Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) method.Results In 41 included
	studies (2541 patients, 4876 arteries), contrast-enhanced MR angiography
	was more sensitive (0·94, 95\% CI 0·88-0·97) and specific (0·93,
	95\% CI 0·89-0·96) for 70-99\% stenosis than Doppler ultrasound,
	MR angiography, and CT angiography (sensitivities 0·89, 0·88, 0·76;
	specificities 0·84, 0·84, 0·94, respectively). Data for 50-69\% stenoses
	and combinations of non-invasive tests were sparse and unreliable.
	There was heterogeneity between studies and evidence of publication
	bias.Interpretation Non-invasive tests, used cautiously, could replace
	intra-arterial carotid angiography for 70-99\% stenosis. However,
	more data are required to determine their accuracy, especially at
	50-69\% stenoses where the balance of risk and benefit for carotid
	endarterectomy is particularly narrow, and to explore and overcome
	heterogeneity. Methodology for evaluating imaging tests should be
	improved; blinded, prospective studies in clinically relevant patients
	are essential basic characteristics.},

  abstract = {Plaque formation begins with the transportation of lipoproteins into
	the arterial wall. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) carries most of
	the cholesterol in human plasma and becomes trapped within the subendothelial
	space of the wall. First, the lipid component of LDL is oxidized,
	and this process attracts monocytes to enter the wall and become
	macrophages, which further the oxidative process [1]. High-density
	lipoprotein (HDL) has been shown to inhibit this oxidative process
	[2], thereby providing protection against atherogenesis. Macrophages
	also modify the surface protein of LDL, apoprotein B, making it unrecognizable
	by the LDL receptor and leading to dysregulation with resultant massive
	accumulation of cholesterol [1]. Smooth muscle cells begin to migrate
	into the lesion, stimulated by growth factors released by macrophages,
	platelets (which may have thrombosed beneath an area of endothelial
	injury), endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells [3]. This inflammatory
	process results in modified LDL that is taken up by macrophages or
	smooth muscle cells, leading to the formation of foam cells. The
	accumulation of foam cells and intercellular lipid in the intimal
	layer constitutes the first stage of atherosclerosis called the fatty
	streak. Many have considered the fatty streak to be the precursor
	of fibrous plaque formation; however, some lesions may not develop
	further [4]. Virmani et al [5] classify the fatty streak as intimal
	xanthomata, which refers to focal accumulations of fat-laden macrophages
	within the intima. We know that most intimal xanthomata will regress
	because the distribution of lesions in the third decade of life and
	beyond is very different from the fatty streaks seen in children
	[5]. Fibrous plaque is formed when smooth muscle cells produce a
	fibrous cap around the lipid core. The lipid core consists of an
	extracellular mass of cholesterol esters, and is lined by foam cells.
	The cholesterol esters accumulate as the foam cells consume more
	and more lipid, and eventually become necrotic and break apart, partly
	because of local hypoxia. The lesion grows by a continued inflammatory
	reaction along the shoulder regions adjacent to the edges of the
	lipid core. The final stage of atherosclerosis is the complicated
	atheroma, which is characterized by the presence of ulceration, intraplaque
	hemorrhage, thrombosis, and plates of calcification. Studies of coronary
	arteries have shown calcium granules begin deposition immediately
	with the formation of the lipid core, although plates and lumps of
	calcium form in more advanced lesions [4]. The complicated atheroma
	is frequently associated with a clinically acute event.},

	and proton density (PD)-weighted black-blood images using a fast
	spin-echo sequence with single- (T1-weighted) or multislice (PD-/T2-weighted)

	CNR significantly increased (P < 0.0001) at 3T with a 1.5-fold gain
	for T1-weighted images and a 1.7/1.8-fold gain for PD-/T2-weighted

	images (P = 0.2), but was larger at 3T for multislice DIR PD-/T2-weighted
	images (P = 0.01/0.03). The LA, WA, and MWT demonstrated good agreement

	silent infarct-like brain lesions in migraineurs reinforced this
	hypothesis and raised questions on whether migraine may be a progressive
	disorder rather than simply an episodic disorder. Stroke can occur
	during the course of migraine attacks with aura, supporting the assumption
	of a causal relation between the two diseases. Migraine may accentuate
	other existing risk factors for stroke, and both jointly increase
	the risk of cerebral ischemia outside of migraine attacks. In this
	regard, the role of migraine might be that of predisposing condition
	for cerebral ischemia. Migraine and ischemic stroke may be the end
	phenotype of common pathogenic mechanisms. Evidence of a migraine-stroke
	relation in cases of specific disorders, such as CADASIL (cerebral
	autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy)
	and MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis,
	and stroke-like episodes), strongly supports this concept. Finally,
	acute focal cerebral ischemia can trigger migraine attacks, and,
	thus, migraine may be the consequence of stroke. In this paper, we
	will review contemporary epidemiologic studies, discuss potential
	mechanisms of migraine-induced stroke and comorbid ischemic stroke,
	and pose new research questions.},
