  abstract = {OBJECTIVE--To determine whether the addition of carotid endarterectomy
	to aggressive medical management can reduce the incidence of cerebral
	infarction in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.
	DESIGN--Prospective, randomized, multicenter trial. SETTING--Thirty-nine
	clinical sites across the United States and Canada. PATIENTS--Between
	December 1987 and December 1993, a total of 1662 patients with asymptomatic
	carotid artery stenosis of 60\% or greater reduction in diameter
	were randomized; follow-up data are available on 1659. At baseline,
	recognized risk factors for stroke were similar between the two treatment
	groups. INTERVENTION--Daily aspirin administration and medical risk
	factor management for all patients; carotid endarterectomy for patients
	randomized to receive surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Initially,
	transient ischemic attack or cerebral infarction occurring in the
	distribution of the study artery and any transient ischemic attack,
	stroke, or death occurring in the perioperative period. In March
	1993, the primary outcome measures were changed to cerebral infarction
	occurring in the distribution of the study artery or any stroke or
	death occurring in the perioperative period. RESULTS--After a median
	follow-up of 2.7 years, with 4657 patient-years of observation, the
	aggregate risk over 5 years for ipsilateral stroke and any perioperative
	stroke or death was estimated to be 5.1\% for surgical patients and
	11.0\% for patients treated medically (aggregate risk reduction of
	53\% [95\% confidence interval, 22\% to 72\%]). CONCLUSION--Patients
	with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis of 60\% or greater reduction
	in diameter and whose general health makes them good candidates for
	elective surgery will have a reduced 5-year risk of ipsilateral stroke
	if carotid endarterectomy performed with less than 3\% perioperative
	morbidity and mortality is added to aggressive management of modifiable
	risk factors.},

	Epidemiological studies suggest that migraine may be a risk factor

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that carotid endarterectomy
	in patients with symptomatic severe carotid stenosis (defined as
	stenosis of 70 to 99 percent of the luminal diameter) is beneficial
	up to two years after the procedure. In this clinical trial, we assessed
	the benefit of carotid endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic
	moderate stenosis, defined as stenosis of less than 70 percent. We
	also studied the durability of the benefit of endarterectomy in patients
	with severe stenosis over eight years of follow-up. METHODS: Patients
	who had moderate carotid stenosis and transient ischemic attacks
	or nondisabling strokes on the same side as the stenosis (ipsilateral)
	within 180 days before study entry were stratified according to the
	degree of stenosis (50 to 69 percent or <50 percent) and randomly
	assigned either to undergo carotid endarterectomy (1108 patients)
	or to receive medical care alone (1118 patients). The average follow-up
	was five years, and complete data on outcome events were available
	for 99.7 percent of the patients. The primary outcome event was any
	fatal or nonfatal stroke ipsilateral to the stenosis for which the
	patient underwent randomization. RESULTS: Among patients with stenosis
	of 50 to 69 percent, the five-year rate of any ipsilateral stroke
	(failure rate) was 15.7 percent among patients treated surgically
	and 22.2 percent among those treated medically (P=0.045); to prevent
	one ipsilateral stroke during the five-year period, 15 patients would
	have to be treated with carotid endarterectomy. Among patients with
	less than 50 percent stenosis, the failure rate was not significantly
	lower in the group treated with endarterectomy (14.9 percent) than
	in the medically treated group (18.7 percent, P=0.16). Among the
	patients with severe stenosis who underwent endarterectomy, the 30-day
	rate of death or disabling ipsilateral stroke persisting at 90 days
	was 2.1 percent; this rate increased to only 6.7 percent at 8 years.
	Benefit was greatest among men, patients with recent stroke as the
	qualifying event, and patients with hemispheric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS:
	Endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic moderate carotid stenosis
	of 50 to 69 percent yielded only a moderate reduction in the risk
	of stroke. Decisions about treatment for patients in this category
	must take into account recognized risk factors, and exceptional surgical
	skill is obligatory if carotid endarterectomy is to be performed.
	Patients with stenosis of less than 50 percent did not benefit from
	surgery. Patients with severe stenosis (> or =70 percent) had a durable
	benefit from endarterectomy at eight years of follow-up.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic lesions are heterogeneous and prognosis
	cannot easily be predicted, even with intracoronary ultrasound and
	angioscopy. Serial angiographic and necropsy studies suggest that
	the risk of plaque rupture correlates only weakly with the degree
	of stenosis. Most ruptured plaques are characterised by a large pool
	of cholesterol or necrotic debris and a thin fibrous cap with a dense
	infiltration of macrophages. The release of matrix-digesting enzymes
	by these cells is thought to contribute to plaque rupture. Other
	thromboses are found on non-ruptured but inflamed plaque surfaces.
	We postulated that both types of thrombotic events may be predicted
	by heat released by activated macrophages either on the plaque surface
	or under a thin cap. METHODS: To test the hypothesis, we measured
	the intimal surface temperatures at 20 sites in each of 50 samples
	of carotid artery taken at endarterectomy from 48 patients. The living
	samples were probed with a thermistor (24-gauge needle-tip; accuracy
	0.1 degree C; time contrast 0.15 s). The tissues were then fixed
	and stained. FINDINGS: Plaques showed several regions in which the
	surface temperatures varied reproducibly by 0.2-0.3 degrees C, but
	37\% of plaques had substantially warmer regions (0.4-2.2 degrees
	C). Points with substantially different temperatures could not be
	distinguished from one another by the naked eye; such points could
	also be very close to one another (< 1 mm apart). Temperature correlated
	positively with cell density (r = 0.68, p = 0.0001) and inversely
	with the distance of the cell clusters from the luminal surface (r
	= -0.38, p = 0.0006). Most cells were macrophages. Infrared thermographic
	images also revealed heterogeneity in temperature among the plaques.
	INTERPRETATION: Living atherosclerotic plaques show thermal heterogeneity,
	which raises the possibility that an infrared catheter or other techniques
	that can localise heat or metabolic activity might be able to identify
	plaques at high risk of rupture or thrombosis.},

	of magnetic resonance (MR) to detect arterial thrombotic obstruction
	and define thrombus age. BACKGROUND; Arterial thrombi underlie the
	clinical consequences of atherosclerosis and are not reliably detected
	by current noninvasive diagnostic techniques. METHODS: Carotid thrombi
	were induced in swine (n = 7) by arterial injury. Serial high-resolution
	in vivo MR images were obtained using black-blood T1-weighted (T1W)
	and T2-weighted (T2W) sequences in a clinical 1.5T MR system at 6
	h, 1 day and at 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9 weeks. At each time point one animal
	was sacrificed and the occluded carotid artery processed for histopathology.
	Thrombus signal intensity (SI) was normalized to that of the adjacent
	muscle. Thrombus age was assessed based on MR appearance by two blinded
	independent observers. RESULTS: Thrombus appearance and relative
	SI revealed characteristic temporal changes in multicontrast-weighted
	MR images, reflecting histologic changes in the composition. Acute
	thrombus appeared very bright on the T2W images, facilitating the
	detection. Signal intensity was 197 +/- 25\% at 6 h, peaking at 1
	week (246 +/- 51\%), reaching a plateau by 6 weeks (120 +/- 15\%).
	At six weeks, complete thrombus organization was confirmed histologically.
	The T1W images had similar pattern with lower SI than T2W. Age definition
	using visual appearance was highly accurate (Pearson's chi-square
	with 4 df ranging from 96 to 132 and Cohen's kappa at 0.81 to 0.94).
	Agreement between observers was substantial (Pearson chi-square with
	4 df = 91.5, kappa = 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging
	is a promising tool to noninvasively detect arterial thrombosis.
	Measurement of SI and the characteristic visual appearance of the

	155 plaques from 13 aortas were studied. Four aortas showed intact

  abstract = {The aim of this review is to summarize present knowledge of the ultrasonic
	detection and determinants of carotid atherosclerosis with lipid-rich
	cores and to review the evidence that these measures of plaque type
	may predict cerebral events. With the use of high-resolution ultrasound
	B-mode imaging, carotid plaques evaluated as only weakly reflecting
	the ultrasound beam (echolucent) have been associated with a higher
	risk of neurological events than are plaques reflecting the ultrasound
	signal strongly (echorich). Histologically, these echolucent plaques
	have a higher content of lipid and hemorrhage than do echorich plaques,
	which contain more calcification and fibrous tissue. Findings in
	the coronary arteries indicate that a lipid-rich plaque with a thin,
	fibrous cap is more vulnerable, is more prone to rupture, and cause
	symptoms compared with fibrous plaques. A search for determinants
	in the blood for these vulnerable plaques suggests that low density
	lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is the best lipid predictor for the
	extent of atherosclerosis, whereas triglyceride-rich lipoproteins
	in particular seem to predict an echolucent plaque. Lowering of LDL
	cholesterol and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in plasma is associated
	with reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis and coronary
	events. LDL cholesterol reduction is also associated with a reduced
	stroke rate. These improvements in the prognosis are thought to be
	the result of a reduction in the lipid content of the plaques, making
	them more stable and resistant to rupture rather than an actual reduction
	in plaque volume and degree of stenosis. In conclusion, it appears
	that ultrasound B-mode imaging as well as lipoproteins presumably
	may predict dangerous and rupture-prone, lipid-rich plaques in the
	carotid arteries, thereby being potential diagnostic tools in the
	prevention of neurological events.},

	patients, with at least 50\% carotid stenosis as determined by Doppler

	carotid arteries. Studies were analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively
	in a randomised manner by two experienced readers in consensus, blinded
	to clinical status, and plaques were classified according to the
	modified American Heart Association (AHA) criteria. RESULTS: After
	exclusion of poor quality images, 109 MRI sections in 18 symptomatic
	and 19 asymptomatic patients were available for analysis. There were
	no significant differences in mean luminal stenosis severity (72.9\%
	vs 67.6\%; p = 0.09) or plaque burden (median plaque areas 50 mm(2)
	vs 50 mm(2); p = 0.858) between the symptomatic and asymptomatic
	groups. However, symptomatic lesions had a higher incidence of ruptured
	fibrous caps (36.5\% vs 8.7\%; p = 0.004), haemorrhage or thrombus
	(46.5\% vs 14.0\%; p<0.001), large necrotic lipid cores (63.8\% vs
	28.0\%; p = 0.002) and complicated type VI AHA lesions (61.5\% vs
	28.1\%; p = 0.001) compared with asymptomatic lesions. The MRI findings
	of plaque haemorrhage or thrombus had an odds ratio of 5.25 (95\%
	CI 2.08 to 13.24) while thin or ruptured fibrous cap (as opposed
	to a thick fibrous cap) had an odds ratio of 7.94 (95\% CI 2.93 to
	21.51) for prediction of symptomatic clinical status. CONCLUSIONS:
	There are significant differences in plaque characteristics between
	symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid atheroma and these can be detected
	in vivo by high resolution MRI.},

	and strong indicators of plaque instability. Use of statins is associated
	with a decreased risk of stroke and reportedly improves stability
	of atherosclerotic plaques, but available data addressing the mechanism
	of this effect are conflicting. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed
	data from 94 consecutive patients with internal carotid artery stenosis
	who underwent carotid endarterectomy. Excised plaques underwent systematic
	quantitative immunohistochemical analysis to determine the percentage
	of macrophage area and the percentage of MMP-9 area. Associations
	between percentage of macrophage area and percentage of MMP-9 area
	and use of statins and cerebrovascular disease were examined by univariate
	and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: We found significantly higher
	values of percentage of macrophage area and of MMP-9 area in recently
	symptomatic (n = 26) compared with asymptomatic (n = 68) internal
	carotid artery stenoses: median (IQR) percentage of macrophage area
	was 2.29 (1.53-4.129) vs 0.53 (0.27-0.96) and percentage of MMP-9
	area was 0.61 (0.36-0.89) vs 0.08 (0.02-0.27; both P < .0005). Patients
	treated with statins (n = 49) showed lower percentage values of macrophage
	area and MMP-9 area than untreated patients: the percentage of macrophage
	area was 0.54 (0.31-1.18) vs 1.03 (0.57-2.08; P = .01) and percentage
	of MMP-9 area was 0.06 (0.02-0.22) vs 0.36 (0.16-0.62; P < .0005).
	These associations between statin treatment and percentages of macrophage
	area and MMP-9 area did not change after controlling for symptomatic
	cerebrovascular disease and the effects of other potential confounders
	in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the value
	of percentage of macrophage area and percentage of MMP-9 area as
	markers of plaque instability and provide further evidence to support
	the hypothesis that statins reduce inflammatory responses and thereby
	stabilize carotid atherosclerotic plaques.},

	continues to kill more people than any other disease in the Western

	P947 toward activated MMPs was demonstrated in vitro. The affinity
	and specificity of P947 toward matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-rich
	plaques was evaluated both in vivo using ApoE-/- mice and ex vivo
	in hyperlipidemic rabbits. Gadolinium content quantification and
	MRI showed a preferential accumulation of P947 in atherosclerotic
	lesions compared with the nontargeted reference compound, Gd-DOTA.
	The ex vivo assay on rabbit plaques revealed a higher uptake of P947.
	Moreover, using human carotid artery endarterectomy specimens, P947
	facilitated discrimination between histologically defined MMP-rich
	and MMP-poor plaques. An in vivo MRI investigation in mice revealed

	5. Heterogeneous plaques (types 1 and 2) occurred significantly more
	(p less than 0.001) in symptomatic preoperative arteries than in

	Plaques were subjected to histological examination and quantification

	significantly higher in group 4 (median 125.7 ng/mL for group 4,
	median <32 ng/mL for all other groups; P=0.003), with no difference
	in the levels of MMPs 1, 2, or 3. Furthermore, the MMP-9 concentration
	was significantly higher in plaques undergoing spontaneous embolization

	CONCLUSIONS: The concentration, production, and expression of MMP-9

	acute coronary events, suggesting that systemic factors may determine
	plaque instability. One potentially important factor is pulse pressure.
	There is indirect evidence that cyclical haemodynamic forces affect
	plaque stability, and pulse pressure is a strong predictor of coronary
	events. OBJECTIVE: To study the association between pulse pressure
	and plaque ulceration. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied angiograms
	from 3007 patients with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis in
	the European Carotid Surgery Trial. Presence of ulceration was related
	to the different components of blood pressure [pulse pressure, systolic
	blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic
	blood pressure (DBP)], and adjustment was made for age, sex, diabetes,
	smoking, and the degree of vessel stenosis. RESULTS: Pulse pressure
	was the strongest independent predictor of ulceration of the symptomatic

	We also found pH heterogeneity in plaques from human carotid artery

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thromboembolic disease secondary to complicated carotid
	atherosclerotic plaque is a major cause of cerebral ischemia. Clinical
	management relies on the detection of significant (>70\%) carotid
	stenosis. A large proportion of patients suffer irreversible cerebral
	ischemia as a result of lesser degrees of stenosis. Diagnostic techniques
	that can identify nonstenotic high-risk plaque would therefore be
	beneficial. High-risk plaque is defined histologically if it contains
	hemorrhage/thrombus. Magnetic resonance direct thrombus imaging (MRDTI)
	is capable of detecting methemoglobin within intraplaque hemorrhage.
	We assessed this as a marker of complicated plaque and compared its
	accuracy with histological examination of surgical endarterectomy
	specimens. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-three patients underwent successful
	MRDTI and endarterectomy with histological examination. Of these,
	44 were histologically defined as complicated (type VI plaque). MRDTI
	demonstrated 3 false-positive and 7 false-negative results, giving
	a sensitivity and specificity of 84\%, negative predictive value
	of 70\%, and positive predictive value of 93\%. The interobserver
	(kappa=0.75) and intraobserver (kappa=0.9) agreement for reading
	MRDTI scans was good. CONCLUSIONS: MRDTI of the carotid vessels in
	patients with cerebral ischemia is an accurate means of identifying
	histologically confirmed complicated plaque. The high contrast generated
	by short T1 species within the plaque allows for ease of interpretation,
	making this technique highly applicable in the research and clinical

	endarterectomy for prophylaxis against stroke rose dramatically until
	the mid-1980s, then declined. Our investigation sought to determine
	whether carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of stroke among patients
	with a recent adverse cerebrovascular event and ipsilateral carotid
	stenosis. METHODS. We conducted a randomized trial at 50 clinical
	centers throughout the United States and Canada, in patients in two
	predetermined strata based on the severity of carotid stenosis--30
	to 69 percent and 70 to 99 percent. We report here the results in
	the 659 patients in the latter stratum, who had had a hemispheric
	or retinal transient ischemic attack or a nondisabling stroke within
	the 120 days before entry and had stenosis of 70 to 99 percent in
	the symptomatic carotid artery. All patients received optimal medical
	care, including antiplatelet therapy. Those assigned to surgical
	treatment underwent carotid endarterectomy performed by neurosurgeons
	or vascular surgeons. All patients were examined by neurologists
	1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after entry and then every 4 months. End
	points were assessed by blinded, independent case review. No patient
	was lost to follow-up. RESULTS. Life-table estimates of the cumulative
	risk of any ipsilateral stroke at two years were 26 percent in the
	331 medical patients and 9 percent in the 328 surgical patients--an
	absolute risk reduction (+/- SE) 17 +/- 3.5 percent (P less than
	0.001). For a major or fatal ipsilateral stroke, the corresponding
	estimates were 13.1 percent and 2.5 percent--an absolute risk reduction
	of 10.6 +/- 2.6 percent (P less than 0.001). Carotid endarterectomy
	was still found to be beneficial when all strokes and deaths were
	included in the analysis (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Carotid
	endarterectomy is highly beneficial to patients with recent hemispheric
	and retinal transient ischemic attacks or nondisabling strokes and

	classification (the size and site of the infarct) as one of the following:
	total anterior circulation infarcts (TACIs); partial anterior circulation
	infarcts (PACIs); posterior circulation infarcts (POCIs); and lacunar
	infarcts. Controls were recruited among individuals hospitalized
	for a reason other than cerebrovascular disease at the same institutions
	and matched for age and sex. Patients and controls underwent B-mode
	ultrasonographic measurements of CCA-IMT, and were evaluated by a
	qualified internist and neurologist for the presence of ischemic
	coronary disease and a history of previous stroke or transient ischemic
	attack. RESULTS: Of the 75 patients with an acute ischemic stroke,
	10 (14\%) were classified as TACIs, 34 (45\%) as PACIs, 12 (16\%)
	as POCIs and 19 (25\%) as lacunar infarcts. Mean CCA-IMT was higher
	in patients (1.03+/-0.18 mm) than in controls (0.85+/-0.18 mm; P<0.0001).
	The history of cerebrovascular disease was much lower in the patients

	was in the range of 20\% in patients with TACIs to more than 40\%

	morphology with the patient's presenting symptoms has drawn conflicting
	conclusions. The purpose of this series was to correlate carotid
	plaque characteristics with the presenting symptoms from a large
	cohort of patients who underwent operation for carotid artery disease.
	METHODS: From a series of 1252 consecutive patients who underwent
	carotid endarterectomy, presenting symptoms were divided into three
	groups: transiently symptomatic (transient ischemic attack [TIA]
	or amaurosis fugax), prior stroke, and asymptomatic. Plaque characteristics,
	including ulceration, intraplaque hemorrhage, and degree of stenosis,
	were recorded prospectively for 1008 procedures. All endarterectomy
	specimens were inspected during the procedure, and plaque characteristics
	were recorded immediately after operation. RESULTS: There was a higher
	incidence of plaque ulceration in the transiently symptomatic and
	prior stroke groups (391 of 508 [77\%] and 91 of 115 [79\%]) than
	in the asymptomatic cohort (231 of 385 [60\%]; p < 0.0001, chi2 test).
	There was no significant difference in the incidence of plaque hemorrhage
	between the transiently symptomatic and prior stroke patients compared
	with the asymptomatic patients. There was no statistical difference
	for ulcerated plaque or plaque hemorrhage between the transiently
	symptomatic and prior stroke group. Intraplaque hemorrhage occurred
	more frequently in patients with high-grade stenosis (90\% to 99\%)
	than in those with less than 90\% stenosis (202 of 299 [68\%] versus
	97 of 299 [32\%]; p = 0.01, chi2 test). CONCLUSIONS: On gross examination
	of the carotid specimen in the operating room, plaque ulceration
	correlates with an initial presentation of amaurosis fugax, TIA,
	or prior stroke compared with patients operated on for asymptomatic
	disease. The presence of intraplaque hemorrhage is associated with
	more advanced stenosis of the internal carotid artery. These findings
	suggest that plaque morphology does play an important role in the

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major thrombotic and embolic complications of atherosclerosis
	are closely associated with irregularity and rupture of atheromatous
	plaques in both the carotid and coronary arteries. Plaque instability
	is partly determined by local factors, but systemic factors, such
	as infection, autoimmunity, or genes, may also be important. If plaque
	stability is influenced by systemic factors that are present in only
	a proportion of patients, some individuals should be more prone to
	rupture of plaques than others--ie, irregular plaques should occur
	in multiple vascular beds in some individuals more frequently than
	would be expected by chance alone. METHODS: We studied 5393 carotid
	bifurcation angiograms from 3007 patients with a recently symptomatic
	carotid stenosis. We assessed the extent to which plaque-surface
	irregularity at the symptomatic carotid artery was associated with
	irregularity at a distant site, the contralateral carotid artery,
	and the extent to which plaque irregularity at these sites was associated
	with previous myocardial infarction or subsequent non-stroke vascular
	death (due mainly to coronary-artery disease). FINDINGS: Patients
	with plaque-surface irregularity (n=1897) in the symptomatic carotid
	artery were more likely than those with smooth plaque (n=110) to
	have irregularity in the contralateral carotid artery (odds ratio
	2.21 [95\% CI 1.62-3.01], p<0.001). Patients with irregular plaques
	in both arteries were more likely to have had a previous myocardial
	infarction than patients with smooth plaques (hazard ratio 1.82 [1.23-2.64],
	p<0.001), and were more likely to have a non-stroke vascular death
	on follow-up (hazard ratio 1.67 [1.15-2.44], p=0.007). However, there
	was no difference in the risk of non-vascular death (hazard ratio
	0.92 [0.57-1.45], p=0.5). These associations were not explicable
	on the basis of differences in traditional vascular risk factors.
	INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that some individuals have a systemic
	predisposition to irregularity and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques
	that is independent of traditional vascular risk factors. This finding
	supports the hypothesis that other systemic factors are important
	in the cause of plaque instability.},

	ipsilateral ischaemic stroke, and is the treatment of choice, in
	patients with recently symptomatic 70-99\% carotid stenosis. However,
	the 3-year risk of stroke on medical treatment alone is only about
	20\%. We investigated whether the efficacy of endarterectomy would
	be improved if patients with a high risk of stroke on medical treatment
	and a low risk of operative stroke or death could be identified.
	METHODS: We developed two prognostic models from data on patients
	with 0-69\% carotid stenosis in the European Carotid Surgery Trial
	(ECST). The medical model predicted risk of ipsilateral carotid territory
	major ischaemic stroke (fatal or lasting longer than 7 days) on medical
	treatment and the surgical model predicted risk of major stroke and
	death within 30 days of endarterectomy. From these models we developed
	a prognostic score to identify patients with a high risk of stroke
	on medical treatment but a low operative risk. We validated the models
	and tested the scoring system on 990 ECST patients with 70-99\% carotid
	stenosis assigned surgery (594) or medical treatment only (396).
	FINDINGS: When patients with 70-99\% stenosis were stratified by
	the scoring system, which was based on seven independent prognostic
	factors, endarterectomy was beneficial in only 162 (16\%) patients.
	The 5-year absolute risk of carotid territory ipsilateral major ischaemic
	stroke, operative major stroke, or death was lowered by 33\% in the
	16\% of patients with a score of 4 or more (odds ratio 0.12 [95\%
	CI 0.05-0.29], p<0.0001), but not in the other 828 (84\%) patients
	(1.00 [0.65-1.54], p=0.7). INTERPRETATION: Many patients with recently
	symptomatic 70-99\% carotid stenosis may not benefit from carotid
	endarterectomy. Validation of the predictive score is needed on external
	datasets, but risk-factor modelling could be useful to identify those
	patients in whom endarterectomy will be beneficial.},

	to image inflammatory cell activity non-invasively by PET. In this
	study we tested whether 18FDG-PET imaging can identify inflammation
	within carotid artery atherosclerotic plaques. METHODS AND RESULTS:
	Eight patients with symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis were imaged
	using 18FDG-PET and co-registered CT. Symptomatic carotid plaques
	were visible in 18FDG-PET images acquired 3 hours post-18FDG injection.
	The estimated net 18FDG accumulation rate (plaque/integral plasma)
	in symptomatic lesions was 27\% higher than in contralateral asymptomatic
	lesions. There was no measurable 18FDG uptake into normal carotid
	arteries. Autoradiography of excised plaques confirmed accumulation
	of deoxyglucose in macrophage-rich areas of the plaque. CONCLUSIONS:
	This study demonstrates that atherosclerotic plaque inflammation
	can be imaged with 18FDG-PET, and that symptomatic, unstable plaques
	accumulate more 18FDG than asymptomatic lesions.},

	plaque. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role and the
	diagnostic efficacy of multidetector row CT angiography (MDCTA) and
	ultrasound (US) echo color Doppler (US-ECD) in the study of patients
	with carotid plaque complicated by ulceration through the comparison
	with the surgical observation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January
	2004 to October 2005, 237 patients, for a total of 474 carotid arteries,
	studied at first with color Doppler US, were analyzed using CT angiography.
	A total of 103 patients underwent a carotid endarterectomy. We analyzed
	stenosis degree, plaque composition, and presence of ulcerations.
	In a second phase, the data were compared with the surgical results
	when the MDCTA indicated surgical intervention. RESULTS: MDCTA found
	31 ulcerations; the surgical confirmation underlined a 93.75\% sensitivity
	and a 98.59\% specificity. US-ECD performances were 37.5\% and 91.5\%
	for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The number of patients
	who showed plaque ulcerations increased with the severity of stenosis.
	Furthermore, ulcerations of the carotid plaque occurred more often
	proximal than distal to the point of maximum stenosis, and this trend
	increased with the severity of the stenosis. We also determined that
	fatty plaques were more likely to be affected by ulcerations. CONCLUSIONS:
	The results of our study suggest that MDCTA detects with higher sensitivity
	and specificity the presence of ulcerated plaque compared with US-ECD,
	which has been demonstrated to be less effective in this evaluation.
	Considering the high MDCTA sensitivity and specificity for detection
	of plaque ulceration, we therefore recommend MDCTA as a useful step
	for correct presurgical planning.},

	determining the degree of carotid stenosis. Methods and Materials:
	From January 2004 to February 2007, 187 patients who had previously
	undergone both US-ECD and MDCTA were studied retrospectively. For
	each patient, stenosis degree was measured by applying the North
	American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria. Data
	derived from MDCTA and US-ECD were then compared to calculate the
	inter-technique variability by using Cohen kappa statistics. For
	all plaque types (fatty, mixed and calcified), inter-technique variability
	was assessed. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to highlight
	differences between the procedures, and scatterplots were also calculated.
	As a gold standard, reference surgical comparisons were performed
	in 50 patients. Results: The percentage of observed agreements in
	the evaluation of stenosis degree was 72.19\% with a kappa value
	of 0.659 (95\% confidence interval: 0.604-0.715) and a weighted kappa
	of 0.789. After the evaluating stenosis degree in fatty, mixed and

	the main cause of acute coronary events. At present it is not known

	depends more on plaque composition and vulnerability (plaque type)
	than on the degree of stenosis (plaque size). Lipid accumulation
	and chronic inflammation, particularly macrophage activities, seem
	to influence the development and the stability of a plaque and thus
	its propensity to rupture. Macrophages have the ability to secrete
	proteolytic enzymes and often infiltrate the region of imminent plaque
	rupture, and disruption may be associated with a generalized inflammatory
	reaction. Further, plaque disruption tends to occur at points where
	the plaque surface is weakest, corresponding to locations where mechanical
	and hemodynamic forces have their highest impact. The risk of plaque
	disruption is a function of both plaque vulnerability (intrinsic
	disease) and rupture triggers (extrinsic forces). The former predisposes
	the plaque to rupture; the latter may precipitate rupture. The danger
	of vulnerable plaques, however, is not related to disruption as such
	but to the resulting thrombosis. The magnitude of this thrombotic
	response and the ensuing flow obstruction depends on the contents
	and quantity of exposed thrombogenic plaque material, the degree

	syndromes and stroke. Therefore, the ability to detect thrombus in
	vivo has a significant clinical implication. Magnetic resonance imaging
	(MRI) has shown promise in noninvasive thrombus detection. However,
	thrombus characterization and age definition remain difficult. We
	sought to evaluate the use of a fibrin-targeted peptide (EP-2104R)
	for MR thrombus detection and to compare this modality with non-contrast-enhanced
	(NCE) MRI and with Gd-DTPA injection at various ages and time points
	after thrombus generation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Carotid artery thrombosis
	was induced by external injury and stasis in 18 rabbits. T1-weighted
	MRI was performed before and after contrast agent injection, within
	6 hours of thrombus induction, at 48 hours, at 1 week, and every
	week up to 8 weeks after injury. Correlation with histopathology
	was performed. The fibrin-targeted contrast agent accurately detected
	all thrombi, regardless of their size, location, and age. Although
	thrombus signal intensity after injection decreased with thrombus
	age (P<0.001), enhancement at 8 weeks was still present. Gd-DTPA
	injection was not associated with an improvement of thrombus detection.
	EP-2104R was superior to both NCE and Gd-DTPA injection (P<0.001).
	Histopathologic examination showed thrombus organization over time.
	Fibrin was gradually replaced by fibrous tissue. A strong correlation
	was found between thrombus enhancement and collagen content of the
	organizing thrombus with time (R=-0.89; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In
	an experimental animal model of carotid thrombosis, we have demonstrated
	the superiority of a fibrin-targeted MR contrast agent for in vivo
	detection of chronic or organized thrombus, compared with NCE MRI

	we sought to determine if atherosclerotic plaque inflammation could
	be measured noninvasively in humans using positron emission tomography
	(PET). BACKGROUND: Earlier PET studies using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
	demonstrated increased FDG uptake in atherosclerotic plaques. Here
	we tested the ability of FDG-PET to measure carotid plaque inflammation
	in patients who subsequently underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
	METHODS: Seventeen patients with severe carotid stenoses underwent
	FDG-PET imaging 3 h after FDG administration (13 to 25 mCi), after
	which carotid plaque FDG uptake was determined as the ratio of plaque
	to blood activity (target to background ratio, TBR). Less than 1
	month after imaging, subjects underwent CEA, after which carotid
	specimens were processed to identify macrophages (staining with anti-CD68
	antibodies). RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between
	the PET signal from the carotid plaques and the macrophage staining
	from the corresponding histologic sections (r = 0.70; p < 0.0001).
	When mean FDG uptake (mean TBR) was compared with mean inflammation
	(mean percentage CD68 staining) for each of the 17 patients, the
	correlation was even stronger (r = 0.85; p < 0.0001). Fluorodeoxyglucose
	uptake did not correlate with plaque area, plaque thickness, or area
	of smooth muscle cell staining. CONCLUSIONS: We established that
	FDG-PET imaging can be used to assess the severity of inflammation
	in carotid plaques in patients. If subsequent natural history studies
	link increased FDG-PET activity in carotid arteries with clinical
	events, this noninvasive measure could be used to identify a subset
	of patients with carotid atherosclerosis in need of intensified medical
	therapy or carotid artery intervention to prevent stroke.},

	dichotomous variables. RESULTS: There was a strong level of agreement
	between field strengths for all morphologic variables, with ICCs
	ranging from 0.88 to 0.96. Agreement in the identification of presence
	or absence of plaque components was very good for calcification (kappa
	= 0.72), lipid-rich necrotic core (kappa = 0.73), and hemorrhage
	(kappa = 0.66). However, the visualization of hemorrhage was greater
	at 1.5 T than at 3.0 T (14.7\% vs 7.8\%, P < .001). Calcifications
	measured significantly (P = .03) larger at 3.0 T, while lipid-rich
	necrotic cores without hemorrhage were similar between field strengths
	(P = .9). CONCLUSION: At higher field strengths, the increased susceptibility
	of calcification and paramagnetic ferric iron in hemorrhage may alter
	quantification and/or detection. Nevertheless, imaging criteria at
	1.5 T for carotid vessel wall interpretation are applicable at 3.0
	T.},

	efficacy of CT angiography for the characterization of plaque morphology
	and composition in carotid atherosclerotic disease. METHODS: Fifty-five
	patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were imaged preoperatively
	with single-slice spiral CT angiography. One hundred sixty-five endarterectomy
	sections were examined histologically at selected levels through
	the distal common and proximal internal carotid arteries. Plaque
	density was measured (in Hounsfield units) on axial CT sections,
	and the presence or absence of ulceration was noted. These observations
	were compared with the histological findings at corresponding levels.
	Data were analyzed with 2-sample t tests and 1-way analysis of variance
	(ANOVA). RESULTS: ANOVA testing showed a statistically significant
	decrease in CT attenuation values with increasing plaque lipid but
	with a very high standard deviation of values. No other histological
	factor showed a statistically significant link with CT attenuation.
	Plaque ulceration was detected by CT with a sensitivity of 60\% and
	a specificity of 74\%. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of plaque attenuation
	with single-slice spiral CT does not give useful information concerning
	plaque composition. The predictive value of CT for the detection
	of plaque ulceration was moderate. Single-slice CT angiography is
	insufficiently robust to be a useful tool for the characterization
	of carotid plaque composition and morphology.},

  abstract = {Plaque formation begins with the transportation of lipoproteins into
	the arterial wall. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) carries most of
	the cholesterol in human plasma and becomes trapped within the subendothelial
	space of the wall. First, the lipid component of LDL is oxidized,
	and this process attracts monocytes to enter the wall and become
	macrophages, which further the oxidative process [1]. High-density
	lipoprotein (HDL) has been shown to inhibit this oxidative process
	[2], thereby providing protection against atherogenesis. Macrophages
	also modify the surface protein of LDL, apoprotein B, making it unrecognizable
	by the LDL receptor and leading to dysregulation with resultant massive
	accumulation of cholesterol [1]. Smooth muscle cells begin to migrate
	into the lesion, stimulated by growth factors released by macrophages,
	platelets (which may have thrombosed beneath an area of endothelial
	injury), endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells [3]. This inflammatory
	process results in modified LDL that is taken up by macrophages or
	smooth muscle cells, leading to the formation of foam cells. The
	accumulation of foam cells and intercellular lipid in the intimal
	layer constitutes the first stage of atherosclerosis called the fatty
	streak. Many have considered the fatty streak to be the precursor
	of fibrous plaque formation; however, some lesions may not develop
	further [4]. Virmani et al [5] classify the fatty streak as intimal
	xanthomata, which refers to focal accumulations of fat-laden macrophages
	within the intima. We know that most intimal xanthomata will regress
	because the distribution of lesions in the third decade of life and
	beyond is very different from the fatty streaks seen in children
	[5]. Fibrous plaque is formed when smooth muscle cells produce a
	fibrous cap around the lipid core. The lipid core consists of an
	extracellular mass of cholesterol esters, and is lined by foam cells.
	The cholesterol esters accumulate as the foam cells consume more
	and more lipid, and eventually become necrotic and break apart, partly
	because of local hypoxia. The lesion grows by a continued inflammatory
	reaction along the shoulder regions adjacent to the edges of the
	lipid core. The final stage of atherosclerosis is the complicated
	atheroma, which is characterized by the presence of ulceration, intraplaque
	hemorrhage, thrombosis, and plates of calcification. Studies of coronary
	arteries have shown calcium granules begin deposition immediately
	with the formation of the lipid core, although plates and lumps of
	calcium form in more advanced lesions [4]. The complicated atheroma
	is frequently associated with a clinically acute event.},

	circulating a complex liquid. The hallmarks of blood flow in arteries

	generated at curves and branches. Arteries can adapt to and modify
	hemodynamic conditions, and unusual hemodynamic conditions may cause
	an abnormal biological response. Velocity profile skewing can create
	pockets in which the wall shear stress is low and oscillates in direction.
	Atherosclerosis tends to localize to these sites and creates a narrowing
	of the artery lumen-a stenosis. Plaque rupture or endothelial injury
	can stimulate thrombosis, which can block blood flow to heart or
	brain tissues, causing a heart attack or stroke. The small lumen
	and elevated shear rate in a stenosis create conditions that accelerate
	platelet accumulation and occlusion. The relationship between thrombosis
	and fluid mechanics is complex, especially in the post-stenotic flow
	field. New convection models have been developed to predict clinical
	occlusion from platelet thrombosis in diseased arteries. Future hemodynamic

	3T scanners with a similar protocol providing transverse T1-, T2-,
	and proton density (PD)-weighted black-blood images using a fast
	spin-echo sequence with single- (T1-weighted) or multislice (PD-/T2-weighted)

	in 44 artery cross-sections by paired t-test. Interscanner variability
	of the lumen area (LA), wall area (WA), and mean wall thickness (MWT)
	was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: Wall SNR and lumen/wall
	CNR significantly increased (P < 0.0001) at 3T with a 1.5-fold gain
	for T1-weighted images and a 1.7/1.8-fold gain for PD-/T2-weighted
	images. Lumen SNR did not differ for single-slice DIR T1-weighted
	images (P = 0.2), but was larger at 3T for multislice DIR PD-/T2-weighted
	images (P = 0.01/0.03). The LA, WA, and MWT demonstrated good agreement
	with no significant bias (P 0.5), a coefficient of variation (CV)
	of < 10\%, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of > 0.95.
	CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated significant improvement in SNR,
	CNR, and image quality for high- resolution black-blood imaging of
	carotid arteries at 3T. Morphologic measurements are compatible between

  abstract = {Numerous epidemiologic observations reporting high prevalence of migraine
	among young individuals with stroke as well as dysfunction of cerebral
	arteries during migraine attacks prompt speculation on the existence
	of a comorbidity between the two disorders. The recent finding of
	silent infarct-like brain lesions in migraineurs reinforced this
	hypothesis and raised questions on whether migraine may be a progressive
	disorder rather than simply an episodic disorder. Stroke can occur
	during the course of migraine attacks with aura, supporting the assumption
	of a causal relation between the two diseases. Migraine may accentuate
	other existing risk factors for stroke, and both jointly increase
	the risk of cerebral ischemia outside of migraine attacks. In this
	regard, the role of migraine might be that of predisposing condition
	for cerebral ischemia. Migraine and ischemic stroke may be the end
	phenotype of common pathogenic mechanisms. Evidence of a migraine-stroke
	relation in cases of specific disorders, such as CADASIL (cerebral
	autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy)
	and MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis,
	and stroke-like episodes), strongly supports this concept. Finally,
	acute focal cerebral ischemia can trigger migraine attacks, and,
	thus, migraine may be the consequence of stroke. In this paper, we
	will review contemporary epidemiologic studies, discuss potential
	mechanisms of migraine-induced stroke and comorbid ischemic stroke,
	and pose new research questions.},
