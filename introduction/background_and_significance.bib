  abstract = {OBJECTIVE--To determine whether the addition of carotid endarterectomy
	to aggressive medical management can reduce the incidence of cerebral
	infarction in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.
	DESIGN--Prospective, randomized, multicenter trial. SETTING--Thirty-nine
	clinical sites across the United States and Canada. PATIENTS--Between
	December 1987 and December 1993, a total of 1662 patients with asymptomatic
	carotid artery stenosis of 60\% or greater reduction in diameter
	were randomized; follow-up data are available on 1659. At baseline,
	recognized risk factors for stroke were similar between the two treatment
	groups. INTERVENTION--Daily aspirin administration and medical risk
	factor management for all patients; carotid endarterectomy for patients
	randomized to receive surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Initially,
	transient ischemic attack or cerebral infarction occurring in the
	distribution of the study artery and any transient ischemic attack,
	stroke, or death occurring in the perioperative period. In March
	1993, the primary outcome measures were changed to cerebral infarction
	occurring in the distribution of the study artery or any stroke or
	death occurring in the perioperative period. RESULTS--After a median
	follow-up of 2.7 years, with 4657 patient-years of observation, the
	aggregate risk over 5 years for ipsilateral stroke and any perioperative
	stroke or death was estimated to be 5.1\% for surgical patients and
	11.0\% for patients treated medically (aggregate risk reduction of
	53\% [95\% confidence interval, 22\% to 72\%]). CONCLUSION--Patients
	with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis of 60\% or greater reduction
	in diameter and whose general health makes them good candidates for
	elective surgery will have a reduced 5-year risk of ipsilateral stroke
	if carotid endarterectomy performed with less than 3\% perioperative
	morbidity and mortality is added to aggressive management of modifiable
	risk factors.},

	Epidemiological studies suggest that migraine may be a risk factor

	abnormalities may be more frequent in migraine patients than in controls;
	and stroke may occur during the course of a migraine with aura (MA)
	attack (migrainous stroke). However, the relationship between migraine,
	aura and stroke is complex and mechanisms other than a direct cause/effect
	relationship are possible. Migraine aura may be the consequence,
	rather than the cause of cerebral ischaemia. Furthermore both MA
	and stroke may be secondary to a third underlying condition. In this
	review we analyse data regarding the relationship between migraine
	and stroke considering 3 aspects: (1) migraine as a risk factor for
	stroke, (2) migraine as a cause of stroke and (3) migraine and cerebral
	ischaemia sharing a common cause.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that carotid endarterectomy
	in patients with symptomatic severe carotid stenosis (defined as
	stenosis of 70 to 99 percent of the luminal diameter) is beneficial
	up to two years after the procedure. In this clinical trial, we assessed
	the benefit of carotid endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic
	moderate stenosis, defined as stenosis of less than 70 percent. We
	also studied the durability of the benefit of endarterectomy in patients
	with severe stenosis over eight years of follow-up. METHODS: Patients
	who had moderate carotid stenosis and transient ischemic attacks
	or nondisabling strokes on the same side as the stenosis (ipsilateral)
	within 180 days before study entry were stratified according to the
	degree of stenosis (50 to 69 percent or <50 percent) and randomly
	assigned either to undergo carotid endarterectomy (1108 patients)
	or to receive medical care alone (1118 patients). The average follow-up
	was five years, and complete data on outcome events were available
	for 99.7 percent of the patients. The primary outcome event was any
	fatal or nonfatal stroke ipsilateral to the stenosis for which the
	patient underwent randomization. RESULTS: Among patients with stenosis
	of 50 to 69 percent, the five-year rate of any ipsilateral stroke
	(failure rate) was 15.7 percent among patients treated surgically
	and 22.2 percent among those treated medically (P=0.045); to prevent
	one ipsilateral stroke during the five-year period, 15 patients would
	have to be treated with carotid endarterectomy. Among patients with
	less than 50 percent stenosis, the failure rate was not significantly
	lower in the group treated with endarterectomy (14.9 percent) than
	in the medically treated group (18.7 percent, P=0.16). Among the
	patients with severe stenosis who underwent endarterectomy, the 30-day
	rate of death or disabling ipsilateral stroke persisting at 90 days
	was 2.1 percent; this rate increased to only 6.7 percent at 8 years.
	Benefit was greatest among men, patients with recent stroke as the
	qualifying event, and patients with hemispheric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS:
	Endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic moderate carotid stenosis
	of 50 to 69 percent yielded only a moderate reduction in the risk
	of stroke. Decisions about treatment for patients in this category
	must take into account recognized risk factors, and exceptional surgical
	skill is obligatory if carotid endarterectomy is to be performed.
	Patients with stenosis of less than 50 percent did not benefit from
	surgery. Patients with severe stenosis (> or =70 percent) had a durable
	benefit from endarterectomy at eight years of follow-up.},

	endarterectomy for prophylaxis against stroke rose dramatically until
	the mid-1980s, then declined. Our investigation sought to determine
	whether carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of stroke among patients
	with a recent adverse cerebrovascular event and ipsilateral carotid
	stenosis. METHODS. We conducted a randomized trial at 50 clinical
	centers throughout the United States and Canada, in patients in two
	predetermined strata based on the severity of carotid stenosis--30
	to 69 percent and 70 to 99 percent. We report here the results in
	the 659 patients in the latter stratum, who had had a hemispheric
	or retinal transient ischemic attack or a nondisabling stroke within
	the 120 days before entry and had stenosis of 70 to 99 percent in
	the symptomatic carotid artery. All patients received optimal medical
	care, including antiplatelet therapy. Those assigned to surgical
	treatment underwent carotid endarterectomy performed by neurosurgeons
	or vascular surgeons. All patients were examined by neurologists
	1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after entry and then every 4 months. End
	points were assessed by blinded, independent case review. No patient
	was lost to follow-up. RESULTS. Life-table estimates of the cumulative
	risk of any ipsilateral stroke at two years were 26 percent in the
	331 medical patients and 9 percent in the 328 surgical patients--an
	absolute risk reduction (+/- SE) 17 +/- 3.5 percent (P less than
	0.001). For a major or fatal ipsilateral stroke, the corresponding
	estimates were 13.1 percent and 2.5 percent--an absolute risk reduction
	of 10.6 +/- 2.6 percent (P less than 0.001). Carotid endarterectomy
	was still found to be beneficial when all strokes and deaths were
	included in the analysis (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Carotid
	endarterectomy is highly beneficial to patients with recent hemispheric
	and retinal transient ischemic attacks or nondisabling strokes and
	ipsilateral high-grade stenosis (70 to 99 percent) of the internal
	carotid artery.},

	with ischemic brain infarctions (IBIs) were consecutively recruited
	and classified into subtypes by computed tomography and Bamford's
	classification (the size and site of the infarct) as one of the following:
	total anterior circulation infarcts (TACIs); partial anterior circulation
	infarcts (PACIs); posterior circulation infarcts (POCIs); and lacunar
	infarcts. Controls were recruited among individuals hospitalized
	for a reason other than cerebrovascular disease at the same institutions
	and matched for age and sex. Patients and controls underwent B-mode
	ultrasonographic measurements of CCA-IMT, and were evaluated by a
	qualified internist and neurologist for the presence of ischemic
	coronary disease and a history of previous stroke or transient ischemic
	attack. RESULTS: Of the 75 patients with an acute ischemic stroke,
	10 (14\%) were classified as TACIs, 34 (45\%) as PACIs, 12 (16\%)
	as POCIs and 19 (25\%) as lacunar infarcts. Mean CCA-IMT was higher
	in patients (1.03+/-0.18 mm) than in controls (0.85+/-0.18 mm; P<0.0001).
	The history of cerebrovascular disease was much lower in the patients
	with POCI and TACI, and the prevalence of ischemic cardiac disease
	was in the range of 20\% in patients with TACIs to more than 40\%
	in patients with PACIs. CONCLUSIONS: An increased CCA-IMT as a marker
	of general atherosclerosis was associated with IBI and reflects cardiovascular
	risk. Carotid and coronary atherosclerosis were positively correlated
	with IBIs, with significant differences across the subtypes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major thrombotic and embolic complications of atherosclerosis
	are closely associated with irregularity and rupture of atheromatous
	plaques in both the carotid and coronary arteries. Plaque instability
	is partly determined by local factors, but systemic factors, such
	as infection, autoimmunity, or genes, may also be important. If plaque
	stability is influenced by systemic factors that are present in only
	a proportion of patients, some individuals should be more prone to
	rupture of plaques than others--ie, irregular plaques should occur
	in multiple vascular beds in some individuals more frequently than
	would be expected by chance alone. METHODS: We studied 5393 carotid
	bifurcation angiograms from 3007 patients with a recently symptomatic
	carotid stenosis. We assessed the extent to which plaque-surface
	irregularity at the symptomatic carotid artery was associated with
	irregularity at a distant site, the contralateral carotid artery,
	and the extent to which plaque irregularity at these sites was associated
	with previous myocardial infarction or subsequent non-stroke vascular
	death (due mainly to coronary-artery disease). FINDINGS: Patients
	with plaque-surface irregularity (n=1897) in the symptomatic carotid
	artery were more likely than those with smooth plaque (n=110) to
	have irregularity in the contralateral carotid artery (odds ratio
	2.21 [95\% CI 1.62-3.01], p<0.001). Patients with irregular plaques
	in both arteries were more likely to have had a previous myocardial
	infarction than patients with smooth plaques (hazard ratio 1.82 [1.23-2.64],
	p<0.001), and were more likely to have a non-stroke vascular death
	on follow-up (hazard ratio 1.67 [1.15-2.44], p=0.007). However, there
	was no difference in the risk of non-vascular death (hazard ratio
	0.92 [0.57-1.45], p=0.5). These associations were not explicable
	on the basis of differences in traditional vascular risk factors.
	INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that some individuals have a systemic
	predisposition to irregularity and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques
	that is independent of traditional vascular risk factors. This finding
	supports the hypothesis that other systemic factors are important
	in the cause of plaque instability.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy lowers the risk of carotid territory
	ipsilateral ischaemic stroke, and is the treatment of choice, in
	patients with recently symptomatic 70-99\% carotid stenosis. However,
	the 3-year risk of stroke on medical treatment alone is only about
	20\%. We investigated whether the efficacy of endarterectomy would
	be improved if patients with a high risk of stroke on medical treatment
	and a low risk of operative stroke or death could be identified.
	METHODS: We developed two prognostic models from data on patients
	with 0-69\% carotid stenosis in the European Carotid Surgery Trial
	(ECST). The medical model predicted risk of ipsilateral carotid territory
	major ischaemic stroke (fatal or lasting longer than 7 days) on medical
	treatment and the surgical model predicted risk of major stroke and
	death within 30 days of endarterectomy. From these models we developed
	a prognostic score to identify patients with a high risk of stroke
	on medical treatment but a low operative risk. We validated the models
	and tested the scoring system on 990 ECST patients with 70-99\% carotid
	stenosis assigned surgery (594) or medical treatment only (396).
	FINDINGS: When patients with 70-99\% stenosis were stratified by
	the scoring system, which was based on seven independent prognostic
	factors, endarterectomy was beneficial in only 162 (16\%) patients.
	The 5-year absolute risk of carotid territory ipsilateral major ischaemic
	stroke, operative major stroke, or death was lowered by 33\% in the
	16\% of patients with a score of 4 or more (odds ratio 0.12 [95\%
	CI 0.05-0.29], p<0.0001), but not in the other 828 (84\%) patients
	(1.00 [0.65-1.54], p=0.7). INTERPRETATION: Many patients with recently
	symptomatic 70-99\% carotid stenosis may not benefit from carotid
	endarterectomy. Validation of the predictive score is needed on external
	datasets, but risk-factor modelling could be useful to identify those
	patients in whom endarterectomy will be beneficial.},

  abstract = {Numerous epidemiologic observations reporting high prevalence of migraine
	among young individuals with stroke as well as dysfunction of cerebral
	arteries during migraine attacks prompt speculation on the existence
	of a comorbidity between the two disorders. The recent finding of
	silent infarct-like brain lesions in migraineurs reinforced this
	hypothesis and raised questions on whether migraine may be a progressive
	disorder rather than simply an episodic disorder. Stroke can occur
	during the course of migraine attacks with aura, supporting the assumption
	of a causal relation between the two diseases. Migraine may accentuate
	other existing risk factors for stroke, and both jointly increase
	the risk of cerebral ischemia outside of migraine attacks. In this
	regard, the role of migraine might be that of predisposing condition
	for cerebral ischemia. Migraine and ischemic stroke may be the end
	phenotype of common pathogenic mechanisms. Evidence of a migraine-stroke
	relation in cases of specific disorders, such as CADASIL (cerebral
	autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy)
	and MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis,
	and stroke-like episodes), strongly supports this concept. Finally,
	acute focal cerebral ischemia can trigger migraine attacks, and,
	thus, migraine may be the consequence of stroke. In this paper, we
	will review contemporary epidemiologic studies, discuss potential
	mechanisms of migraine-induced stroke and comorbid ischemic stroke,
