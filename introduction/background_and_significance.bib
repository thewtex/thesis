  abstract = {OBJECTIVE--To determine whether the addition of carotid endarterectomy
	to aggressive medical management can reduce the incidence of cerebral
	infarction in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.
	DESIGN--Prospective, randomized, multicenter trial. SETTING--Thirty-nine
	clinical sites across the United States and Canada. PATIENTS--Between
	December 1987 and December 1993, a total of 1662 patients with asymptomatic
	carotid artery stenosis of 60\% or greater reduction in diameter
	were randomized; follow-up data are available on 1659. At baseline,
	recognized risk factors for stroke were similar between the two treatment
	groups. INTERVENTION--Daily aspirin administration and medical risk
	factor management for all patients; carotid endarterectomy for patients
	randomized to receive surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Initially,
	transient ischemic attack or cerebral infarction occurring in the
	distribution of the study artery and any transient ischemic attack,
	stroke, or death occurring in the perioperative period. In March
	1993, the primary outcome measures were changed to cerebral infarction
	occurring in the distribution of the study artery or any stroke or
	death occurring in the perioperative period. RESULTS--After a median
	follow-up of 2.7 years, with 4657 patient-years of observation, the
	aggregate risk over 5 years for ipsilateral stroke and any perioperative
	stroke or death was estimated to be 5.1\% for surgical patients and
	11.0\% for patients treated medically (aggregate risk reduction of
	53\% [95\% confidence interval, 22\% to 72\%]). CONCLUSION--Patients
	with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis of 60\% or greater reduction
	in diameter and whose general health makes them good candidates for
	elective surgery will have a reduced 5-year risk of ipsilateral stroke
	if carotid endarterectomy performed with less than 3\% perioperative
	morbidity and mortality is added to aggressive management of modifiable
	risk factors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that carotid endarterectomy
	in patients with symptomatic severe carotid stenosis (defined as
	stenosis of 70 to 99 percent of the luminal diameter) is beneficial
	up to two years after the procedure. In this clinical trial, we assessed
	the benefit of carotid endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic
	moderate stenosis, defined as stenosis of less than 70 percent. We
	also studied the durability of the benefit of endarterectomy in patients
	with severe stenosis over eight years of follow-up. METHODS: Patients
	who had moderate carotid stenosis and transient ischemic attacks
	or nondisabling strokes on the same side as the stenosis (ipsilateral)
	within 180 days before study entry were stratified according to the
	degree of stenosis (50 to 69 percent or <50 percent) and randomly
	assigned either to undergo carotid endarterectomy (1108 patients)
	or to receive medical care alone (1118 patients). The average follow-up
	was five years, and complete data on outcome events were available
	for 99.7 percent of the patients. The primary outcome event was any
	fatal or nonfatal stroke ipsilateral to the stenosis for which the
	patient underwent randomization. RESULTS: Among patients with stenosis
	of 50 to 69 percent, the five-year rate of any ipsilateral stroke
	(failure rate) was 15.7 percent among patients treated surgically
	and 22.2 percent among those treated medically (P=0.045); to prevent
	one ipsilateral stroke during the five-year period, 15 patients would
	have to be treated with carotid endarterectomy. Among patients with
	less than 50 percent stenosis, the failure rate was not significantly
	lower in the group treated with endarterectomy (14.9 percent) than
	in the medically treated group (18.7 percent, P=0.16). Among the
	patients with severe stenosis who underwent endarterectomy, the 30-day
	rate of death or disabling ipsilateral stroke persisting at 90 days
	was 2.1 percent; this rate increased to only 6.7 percent at 8 years.
	Benefit was greatest among men, patients with recent stroke as the
	qualifying event, and patients with hemispheric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS:
	Endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic moderate carotid stenosis
	of 50 to 69 percent yielded only a moderate reduction in the risk
	of stroke. Decisions about treatment for patients in this category
	must take into account recognized risk factors, and exceptional surgical
	skill is obligatory if carotid endarterectomy is to be performed.
	Patients with stenosis of less than 50 percent did not benefit from
	surgery. Patients with severe stenosis (> or =70 percent) had a durable
	benefit from endarterectomy at eight years of follow-up.},

	smooth muscle cells and monocyte/macrophages in human aortic plaques
	that were intact and to compare the results with those in aortic
	plaques undergoing ulceration and thrombosis. DESIGN--The lipid pool
	was measured as a percentage of the total cross sectional area of
	the plaque. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify cell types
	(monocytes/macrophages (M phi) by EBM11 and HAM56, smooth muscle
	cells by alpha actin). The area of the tissue occupied by each cell
	type was measured by quantitative microscopy in the peripheral (shoulder)
	area of the plaque and the plaque cap. Absolute counts of each cell
	type were expressed as the ratio of SMC:M phi. MATERIAL--Aortas were
	obtained at necropsy from men aged less than 69 years who died suddenly
	(within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms) of ischaemic heart disease.
	155 plaques from 13 aortas were studied. Four aortas showed intact
	plaques only (group A, n = 31). Nine aortas showed both intact plaques
	(group B, n = 79) and plaques that were undergoing thrombosis (group
	C, n = 45). RESULTS--In 41 (91.1\%) of the 45 plaques undergoing
	thrombosis (group C) lipid pools occupied more than 40\% of the cross
	sectional area of the plaque. Only 12 (10.9\%) of the 110 intact
	plaques (groups A + B) had lipid pools of this size. The mean size
	of the lipid pool in plaques of groups A, B, and C was 12.7\%, 27.3\%
	and 56.7\% respectively. Compared with intact plaques those undergoing
	thrombosis contained a smaller volume of smooth muscle cells (2.8\%
	v 11.8\%) and a larger volume of monocyte/macrophages (13.7\% v 2.9\%)
	in the plaque cap. The ratio of the number of smooth muscle cells
	to monocytes/macrophages was 7.8 in group A plaques, 4.1 in group
	B plaques, and 1.0 in group C plaques. This gradient was the result
	of an absolute increase in monocyte/macrophages and an absolute decrease
	in smooth muscle cells. CONCLUSIONS--In the aorta ulceration and
	thrombosis were characteristic of plaques with a high proportion
	of their volume occupied by extracellular lipid, and in which there
	was a shift toward a preponderance of monocyte/macrophages compared
	with smooth muscle cells in the cap.},

  abstract = {The aim of this review is to summarize present knowledge of the ultrasonic
	detection and determinants of carotid atherosclerosis with lipid-rich
	cores and to review the evidence that these measures of plaque type
	may predict cerebral events. With the use of high-resolution ultrasound
	B-mode imaging, carotid plaques evaluated as only weakly reflecting
	the ultrasound beam (echolucent) have been associated with a higher
	risk of neurological events than are plaques reflecting the ultrasound
	signal strongly (echorich). Histologically, these echolucent plaques
	have a higher content of lipid and hemorrhage than do echorich plaques,
	which contain more calcification and fibrous tissue. Findings in
	the coronary arteries indicate that a lipid-rich plaque with a thin,
	fibrous cap is more vulnerable, is more prone to rupture, and cause
	symptoms compared with fibrous plaques. A search for determinants
	in the blood for these vulnerable plaques suggests that low density
	lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is the best lipid predictor for the
	extent of atherosclerosis, whereas triglyceride-rich lipoproteins
	in particular seem to predict an echolucent plaque. Lowering of LDL
	cholesterol and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in plasma is associated
	with reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis and coronary
	events. LDL cholesterol reduction is also associated with a reduced
	stroke rate. These improvements in the prognosis are thought to be
	the result of a reduction in the lipid content of the plaques, making
	them more stable and resistant to rupture rather than an actual reduction
	in plaque volume and degree of stenosis. In conclusion, it appears
	that ultrasound B-mode imaging as well as lipoproteins presumably
	may predict dangerous and rupture-prone, lipid-rich plaques in the
	carotid arteries, thereby being potential diagnostic tools in the
	prevention of neurological events.},

	(MMP-9) are markers of high-risk atherosclerotic carotid plaques
	and strong indicators of plaque instability. Use of statins is associated
	with a decreased risk of stroke and reportedly improves stability
	of atherosclerotic plaques, but available data addressing the mechanism
	of this effect are conflicting. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed
	data from 94 consecutive patients with internal carotid artery stenosis
	who underwent carotid endarterectomy. Excised plaques underwent systematic
	quantitative immunohistochemical analysis to determine the percentage
	of macrophage area and the percentage of MMP-9 area. Associations
	between percentage of macrophage area and percentage of MMP-9 area
	and use of statins and cerebrovascular disease were examined by univariate
	and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: We found significantly higher
	values of percentage of macrophage area and of MMP-9 area in recently
	symptomatic (n = 26) compared with asymptomatic (n = 68) internal
	carotid artery stenoses: median (IQR) percentage of macrophage area
	was 2.29 (1.53-4.129) vs 0.53 (0.27-0.96) and percentage of MMP-9
	area was 0.61 (0.36-0.89) vs 0.08 (0.02-0.27; both P < .0005). Patients
	treated with statins (n = 49) showed lower percentage values of macrophage
	area and MMP-9 area than untreated patients: the percentage of macrophage
	area was 0.54 (0.31-1.18) vs 1.03 (0.57-2.08; P = .01) and percentage
	of MMP-9 area was 0.06 (0.02-0.22) vs 0.36 (0.16-0.62; P < .0005).
	These associations between statin treatment and percentages of macrophage
	area and MMP-9 area did not change after controlling for symptomatic
	cerebrovascular disease and the effects of other potential confounders
	in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the value
	of percentage of macrophage area and percentage of MMP-9 area as
	markers of plaque instability and provide further evidence to support
	the hypothesis that statins reduce inflammatory responses and thereby
	stabilize carotid atherosclerotic plaques.},

	5. Heterogeneous plaques (types 1 and 2) occurred significantly more

	of MMPs in carotid plaques and to correlate this with clinical status,
	cerebral embolization, and histology. METHODS: Plaques were obtained
	from 75 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and
	divided into 4 groups according to symptomatology (group 1, asymptomatic;
	group 2, symptomatic >6 months before surgery; group 3, symptomatic
	within 1 to 6 months; group 4, symptomatic within 1 month). All patients
	underwent preoperative and intraoperative transcranial Doppler monitoring.
	Plaques were subjected to histological examination and quantification
	of MMPs by zymography and ELISA. RESULTS: The level of MMP-9 was
	significantly higher in group 4 (median 125.7 ng/mL for group 4,
	median <32 ng/mL for all other groups; P=0.003), with no difference
	in the levels of MMPs 1, 2, or 3. Furthermore, the MMP-9 concentration
	was significantly higher in plaques undergoing spontaneous embolization
	(P=0.019) and those with histological evidence of plaque instability
	(P<0.03). In situ hybridization demonstrated increased MMP-9 expression
	in highly symptomatic plaques in areas of intense inflammatory infiltrate.
	CONCLUSIONS: The concentration, production, and expression of MMP-9
	is significantly higher in unstable carotid plaques. If this proves
	to be a causal relationship, MMP-9 may be a strong candidate for
	pharmacotherapy aimed at stabilizing plaques and preventing stroke.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Plaque rupture is the principal cause of acute coronary
	ischaemia, and unstable carotid plaques are associated with a high
	risk of ischaemic stroke. Carotid plaque ulceration also predicts
	acute coronary events, suggesting that systemic factors may determine
	plaque instability. One potentially important factor is pulse pressure.
	There is indirect evidence that cyclical haemodynamic forces affect
	plaque stability, and pulse pressure is a strong predictor of coronary
	events. OBJECTIVE: To study the association between pulse pressure
	and plaque ulceration. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied angiograms
	from 3007 patients with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis in
	the European Carotid Surgery Trial. Presence of ulceration was related
	to the different components of blood pressure [pulse pressure, systolic
	blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic
	blood pressure (DBP)], and adjustment was made for age, sex, diabetes,
	smoking, and the degree of vessel stenosis. RESULTS: Pulse pressure
	was the strongest independent predictor of ulceration of the symptomatic
	carotid plaque [adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the upper compared with
	the lower quintile 2.07, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.25 to 3.44;
	P = 0.004]. This relationship was weaker for SBP (OR 1.66, 95\% CI
	1.05 to 2.62; P = 0.02), and non-significant for MAP (OR 1.58, 95\%
	CI 1.01 to 2.48, P = 0.13) and DBP (OR 1.67, 95\% CI 0.73 to 1.87,
	P = 0.50). CONCLUSIONS: Pulse pressure is independently associated
	with carotid plaque ulceration, supporting the hypothesis that pulsatile
	haemodynamic forces are an important cause of plaque rupture.},

	the mid-1980s, then declined. Our investigation sought to determine
	whether carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of stroke among patients
	with a recent adverse cerebrovascular event and ipsilateral carotid
	stenosis. METHODS. We conducted a randomized trial at 50 clinical
	centers throughout the United States and Canada, in patients in two
	predetermined strata based on the severity of carotid stenosis--30
	to 69 percent and 70 to 99 percent. We report here the results in
	the 659 patients in the latter stratum, who had had a hemispheric
	or retinal transient ischemic attack or a nondisabling stroke within
	the 120 days before entry and had stenosis of 70 to 99 percent in
	the symptomatic carotid artery. All patients received optimal medical
	care, including antiplatelet therapy. Those assigned to surgical
	treatment underwent carotid endarterectomy performed by neurosurgeons
	or vascular surgeons. All patients were examined by neurologists
	1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after entry and then every 4 months. End
	points were assessed by blinded, independent case review. No patient
	was lost to follow-up. RESULTS. Life-table estimates of the cumulative
	risk of any ipsilateral stroke at two years were 26 percent in the
	331 medical patients and 9 percent in the 328 surgical patients--an
	absolute risk reduction (+/- SE) 17 +/- 3.5 percent (P less than
	0.001). For a major or fatal ipsilateral stroke, the corresponding
	estimates were 13.1 percent and 2.5 percent--an absolute risk reduction
	of 10.6 +/- 2.6 percent (P less than 0.001). Carotid endarterectomy
	was still found to be beneficial when all strokes and deaths were
	included in the analysis (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Carotid
	endarterectomy is highly beneficial to patients with recent hemispheric

	classification (the size and site of the infarct) as one of the following:
	total anterior circulation infarcts (TACIs); partial anterior circulation

	infarcts. Controls were recruited among individuals hospitalized
	for a reason other than cerebrovascular disease at the same institutions
	and matched for age and sex. Patients and controls underwent B-mode
	ultrasonographic measurements of CCA-IMT, and were evaluated by a
	qualified internist and neurologist for the presence of ischemic
	coronary disease and a history of previous stroke or transient ischemic
	attack. RESULTS: Of the 75 patients with an acute ischemic stroke,
	10 (14\%) were classified as TACIs, 34 (45\%) as PACIs, 12 (16\%)
	as POCIs and 19 (25\%) as lacunar infarcts. Mean CCA-IMT was higher
	in patients (1.03+/-0.18 mm) than in controls (0.85+/-0.18 mm; P<0.0001).
	The history of cerebrovascular disease was much lower in the patients

	morphology with the patient's presenting symptoms has drawn conflicting
	conclusions. The purpose of this series was to correlate carotid
	plaque characteristics with the presenting symptoms from a large
	cohort of patients who underwent operation for carotid artery disease.
	METHODS: From a series of 1252 consecutive patients who underwent
	carotid endarterectomy, presenting symptoms were divided into three
	groups: transiently symptomatic (transient ischemic attack [TIA]
	or amaurosis fugax), prior stroke, and asymptomatic. Plaque characteristics,
	including ulceration, intraplaque hemorrhage, and degree of stenosis,
	were recorded prospectively for 1008 procedures. All endarterectomy
	specimens were inspected during the procedure, and plaque characteristics
	were recorded immediately after operation. RESULTS: There was a higher
	incidence of plaque ulceration in the transiently symptomatic and
	prior stroke groups (391 of 508 [77\%] and 91 of 115 [79\%]) than
	in the asymptomatic cohort (231 of 385 [60\%]; p < 0.0001, chi2 test).
	There was no significant difference in the incidence of plaque hemorrhage
	between the transiently symptomatic and prior stroke patients compared
	with the asymptomatic patients. There was no statistical difference
	for ulcerated plaque or plaque hemorrhage between the transiently
	symptomatic and prior stroke group. Intraplaque hemorrhage occurred
	more frequently in patients with high-grade stenosis (90\% to 99\%)
	than in those with less than 90\% stenosis (202 of 299 [68\%] versus
	97 of 299 [32\%]; p = 0.01, chi2 test). CONCLUSIONS: On gross examination
	of the carotid specimen in the operating room, plaque ulceration
	correlates with an initial presentation of amaurosis fugax, TIA,
	or prior stroke compared with patients operated on for asymptomatic
	disease. The presence of intraplaque hemorrhage is associated with
	more advanced stenosis of the internal carotid artery. These findings
	suggest that plaque morphology does play an important role in the

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major thrombotic and embolic complications of atherosclerosis
	are closely associated with irregularity and rupture of atheromatous
	plaques in both the carotid and coronary arteries. Plaque instability
	is partly determined by local factors, but systemic factors, such
	as infection, autoimmunity, or genes, may also be important. If plaque
	stability is influenced by systemic factors that are present in only
	a proportion of patients, some individuals should be more prone to
	rupture of plaques than others--ie, irregular plaques should occur
	in multiple vascular beds in some individuals more frequently than
	would be expected by chance alone. METHODS: We studied 5393 carotid
	bifurcation angiograms from 3007 patients with a recently symptomatic
	carotid stenosis. We assessed the extent to which plaque-surface
	irregularity at the symptomatic carotid artery was associated with
	irregularity at a distant site, the contralateral carotid artery,
	and the extent to which plaque irregularity at these sites was associated
	with previous myocardial infarction or subsequent non-stroke vascular
	death (due mainly to coronary-artery disease). FINDINGS: Patients
	with plaque-surface irregularity (n=1897) in the symptomatic carotid
	artery were more likely than those with smooth plaque (n=110) to
	have irregularity in the contralateral carotid artery (odds ratio
	2.21 [95\% CI 1.62-3.01], p<0.001). Patients with irregular plaques
	in both arteries were more likely to have had a previous myocardial
	infarction than patients with smooth plaques (hazard ratio 1.82 [1.23-2.64],
	p<0.001), and were more likely to have a non-stroke vascular death
	on follow-up (hazard ratio 1.67 [1.15-2.44], p=0.007). However, there
	was no difference in the risk of non-vascular death (hazard ratio
	0.92 [0.57-1.45], p=0.5). These associations were not explicable
	on the basis of differences in traditional vascular risk factors.
	INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that some individuals have a systemic
	predisposition to irregularity and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques
	that is independent of traditional vascular risk factors. This finding
	supports the hypothesis that other systemic factors are important
	in the cause of plaque instability.},

	ipsilateral ischaemic stroke, and is the treatment of choice, in
	patients with recently symptomatic 70-99\% carotid stenosis. However,
	the 3-year risk of stroke on medical treatment alone is only about
	20\%. We investigated whether the efficacy of endarterectomy would
	be improved if patients with a high risk of stroke on medical treatment
	and a low risk of operative stroke or death could be identified.
	METHODS: We developed two prognostic models from data on patients
	with 0-69\% carotid stenosis in the European Carotid Surgery Trial
	(ECST). The medical model predicted risk of ipsilateral carotid territory
	major ischaemic stroke (fatal or lasting longer than 7 days) on medical
	treatment and the surgical model predicted risk of major stroke and
	death within 30 days of endarterectomy. From these models we developed
	a prognostic score to identify patients with a high risk of stroke
	on medical treatment but a low operative risk. We validated the models
	and tested the scoring system on 990 ECST patients with 70-99\% carotid
	stenosis assigned surgery (594) or medical treatment only (396).
	FINDINGS: When patients with 70-99\% stenosis were stratified by
	the scoring system, which was based on seven independent prognostic
	factors, endarterectomy was beneficial in only 162 (16\%) patients.
	The 5-year absolute risk of carotid territory ipsilateral major ischaemic
	stroke, operative major stroke, or death was lowered by 33\% in the
	16\% of patients with a score of 4 or more (odds ratio 0.12 [95\%
	CI 0.05-0.29], p<0.0001), but not in the other 828 (84\%) patients
	(1.00 [0.65-1.54], p=0.7). INTERPRETATION: Many patients with recently
	symptomatic 70-99\% carotid stenosis may not benefit from carotid
	endarterectomy. Validation of the predictive score is needed on external
	datasets, but risk-factor modelling could be useful to identify those
	patients in whom endarterectomy will be beneficial.},

	the main cause of acute coronary events. At present it is not known

	depends more on plaque composition and vulnerability (plaque type)
	than on the degree of stenosis (plaque size). Lipid accumulation
	and chronic inflammation, particularly macrophage activities, seem
	to influence the development and the stability of a plaque and thus
	its propensity to rupture. Macrophages have the ability to secrete
	proteolytic enzymes and often infiltrate the region of imminent plaque
	rupture, and disruption may be associated with a generalized inflammatory
	reaction. Further, plaque disruption tends to occur at points where
	the plaque surface is weakest, corresponding to locations where mechanical
	and hemodynamic forces have their highest impact. The risk of plaque
	disruption is a function of both plaque vulnerability (intrinsic
	disease) and rupture triggers (extrinsic forces). The former predisposes
	the plaque to rupture; the latter may precipitate rupture. The danger
	of vulnerable plaques, however, is not related to disruption as such
	but to the resulting thrombosis. The magnitude of this thrombotic
	response and the ensuing flow obstruction depends on the contents
	and quantity of exposed thrombogenic plaque material, the degree
	of pre-existing stenosis, and the systemic thrombotic tendency. The
	thrombotic response is a dynamic process that is decisive for the

	K and S. Intimal smooth muscle cells (SMC), especially cells appearing
	to traverse the internal elastic laminae, also contained these enzymes.
	Extracts of atheromatous tissues had approximately twofold greater
	elastase-specific activity than extracts of uninvolved arteries,
	mostly due to cysteine proteases. Cultured human SMC displayed no
	immunoreactive cathepsins K and S and exhibited little or no elastolytic
	activity when incubated with insoluble elastin. SMC stimulated with
	the atheroma-associated cytokines IL-1beta or IFN-gamma secreted
	active cathepsin S and degraded substantial insoluble elastin (15-20
	microg/10(6) cells/24 h). A selective inhibitor of cathepsin S blocked
	> 80\% of this elastolytic activity. The presence of cathepsins K
	and S at sites of vascular matrix remodeling and the ability of SMC
	and macrophages to use these enzymes to degrade elastin supports
	a role for elastolytic cathepsins in vessel wall remodeling and identifies
	novel therapeutic targets in regulating plaque stability.},

  abstract = {Atherosclerosis is now considered a systemic inflammatory disorder
	affecting the arterial tree. Inflammation plays a role in all stages
	of the disease, from the initiation of the fatty streak to the final
	stage of plaque rupture. Atherosclerotic plaques that demonstrate
	the features of active inflammation are more likely to become symptomatic.
	In addition to having a higher risk of developing adverse cardiovascular
	events, patients who have higher indices of inflammation may be more
	likely to develop restenosis after endovascular stenting. Thus, the
	identification of the 'inflamed plaque' is the subject of intense
	research. The detection of the inflamed plaque by the conventional
	modalities of ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography
	and nuclear medicine as well as the novel imaging modalities of optical
	coherence tomography, near-infrared spectroscopy, thermography and
	angioscopy will be examined.},

  abstract = {Plaque formation begins with the transportation of lipoproteins into
	the arterial wall. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) carries most of
	the cholesterol in human plasma and becomes trapped within the subendothelial
	space of the wall. First, the lipid component of LDL is oxidized,
	and this process attracts monocytes to enter the wall and become
	macrophages, which further the oxidative process [1]. High-density
	lipoprotein (HDL) has been shown to inhibit this oxidative process
	[2], thereby providing protection against atherogenesis. Macrophages
	also modify the surface protein of LDL, apoprotein B, making it unrecognizable
	by the LDL receptor and leading to dysregulation with resultant massive
	accumulation of cholesterol [1]. Smooth muscle cells begin to migrate
	into the lesion, stimulated by growth factors released by macrophages,
	platelets (which may have thrombosed beneath an area of endothelial
	injury), endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells [3]. This inflammatory
	process results in modified LDL that is taken up by macrophages or
	smooth muscle cells, leading to the formation of foam cells. The
	accumulation of foam cells and intercellular lipid in the intimal
	layer constitutes the first stage of atherosclerosis called the fatty
	streak. Many have considered the fatty streak to be the precursor
	of fibrous plaque formation; however, some lesions may not develop
	further [4]. Virmani et al [5] classify the fatty streak as intimal
	xanthomata, which refers to focal accumulations of fat-laden macrophages
	within the intima. We know that most intimal xanthomata will regress
	because the distribution of lesions in the third decade of life and
	beyond is very different from the fatty streaks seen in children
	[5]. Fibrous plaque is formed when smooth muscle cells produce a
	fibrous cap around the lipid core. The lipid core consists of an
	extracellular mass of cholesterol esters, and is lined by foam cells.
	The cholesterol esters accumulate as the foam cells consume more
	and more lipid, and eventually become necrotic and break apart, partly
	because of local hypoxia. The lesion grows by a continued inflammatory
	reaction along the shoulder regions adjacent to the edges of the
	lipid core. The final stage of atherosclerosis is the complicated
	atheroma, which is characterized by the presence of ulceration, intraplaque
	hemorrhage, thrombosis, and plates of calcification. Studies of coronary
	arteries have shown calcium granules begin deposition immediately
	with the formation of the lipid core, although plates and lumps of
	calcium form in more advanced lesions [4]. The complicated atheroma
	is frequently associated with a clinically acute event.},

  abstract = {The cardiovascular system is an internal flow loop with multiple branches
	circulating a complex liquid. The hallmarks of blood flow in arteries
	are pulsatility and branches, which cause wail stresses to be cyclical

	generated at curves and branches. Arteries can adapt to and modify
	hemodynamic conditions, and unusual hemodynamic conditions may cause
	an abnormal biological response. Velocity profile skewing can create
	pockets in which the wall shear stress is low and oscillates in direction.
	Atherosclerosis tends to localize to these sites and creates a narrowing
	of the artery lumen-a stenosis. Plaque rupture or endothelial injury
	can stimulate thrombosis, which can block blood flow to heart or
	brain tissues, causing a heart attack or stroke. The small lumen
	and elevated shear rate in a stenosis create conditions that accelerate
	platelet accumulation and occlusion. The relationship between thrombosis
	and fluid mechanics is complex, especially in the post-stenotic flow
	field. New convection models have been developed to predict clinical
	occlusion from platelet thrombosis in diseased arteries. Future hemodynamic
	studies should address the complex mechanics of flow-induced, large-scale

  abstract = {Numerous epidemiologic observations reporting high prevalence of migraine
	among young individuals with stroke as well as dysfunction of cerebral
	arteries during migraine attacks prompt speculation on the existence
	of a comorbidity between the two disorders. The recent finding of
	silent infarct-like brain lesions in migraineurs reinforced this
	hypothesis and raised questions on whether migraine may be a progressive
	disorder rather than simply an episodic disorder. Stroke can occur
	during the course of migraine attacks with aura, supporting the assumption
	of a causal relation between the two diseases. Migraine may accentuate
	other existing risk factors for stroke, and both jointly increase
	the risk of cerebral ischemia outside of migraine attacks. In this
	regard, the role of migraine might be that of predisposing condition
	for cerebral ischemia. Migraine and ischemic stroke may be the end
	phenotype of common pathogenic mechanisms. Evidence of a migraine-stroke
	relation in cases of specific disorders, such as CADASIL (cerebral
	autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy)
	and MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis,
	and stroke-like episodes), strongly supports this concept. Finally,
	acute focal cerebral ischemia can trigger migraine attacks, and,
	thus, migraine may be the consequence of stroke. In this paper, we
	will review contemporary epidemiologic studies, discuss potential
	mechanisms of migraine-induced stroke and comorbid ischemic stroke,
	and pose new research questions.},
