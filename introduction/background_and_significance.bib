  abstract = {The association between migraine and stroke is complex and bidirectional.
	Epidemiological studies suggest that migraine may be a risk factor
	for stroke; magnetic resonance studies suggest that white matter
	abnormalities may be more frequent in migraine patients than in controls;
	and stroke may occur during the course of a migraine with aura (MA)
	attack (migrainous stroke). However, the relationship between migraine,
	aura and stroke is complex and mechanisms other than a direct cause/effect
	relationship are possible. Migraine aura may be the consequence,
	rather than the cause of cerebral ischaemia. Furthermore both MA
	and stroke may be secondary to a third underlying condition. In this
	review we analyse data regarding the relationship between migraine
	and stroke considering 3 aspects: (1) migraine as a risk factor for
	stroke, (2) migraine as a cause of stroke and (3) migraine and cerebral
	ischaemia sharing a common cause.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The present study examined the association between carotid
	atherosclerosis, coronary atherosclerosis and common carotid artery
	intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) in patients with incident ischemic
	stroke and its subtypes (75 cases and 21 controls). METHODS: Cases
	with ischemic brain infarctions (IBIs) were consecutively recruited
	and classified into subtypes by computed tomography and Bamford's
	classification (the size and site of the infarct) as one of the following:
	total anterior circulation infarcts (TACIs); partial anterior circulation
	infarcts (PACIs); posterior circulation infarcts (POCIs); and lacunar
	infarcts. Controls were recruited among individuals hospitalized
	for a reason other than cerebrovascular disease at the same institutions
	and matched for age and sex. Patients and controls underwent B-mode
	ultrasonographic measurements of CCA-IMT, and were evaluated by a
	qualified internist and neurologist for the presence of ischemic
	coronary disease and a history of previous stroke or transient ischemic
	attack. RESULTS: Of the 75 patients with an acute ischemic stroke,
	10 (14\%) were classified as TACIs, 34 (45\%) as PACIs, 12 (16\%)
	as POCIs and 19 (25\%) as lacunar infarcts. Mean CCA-IMT was higher
	in patients (1.03+/-0.18 mm) than in controls (0.85+/-0.18 mm; P<0.0001).
	The history of cerebrovascular disease was much lower in the patients
	with POCI and TACI, and the prevalence of ischemic cardiac disease
	was in the range of 20\% in patients with TACIs to more than 40\%
	in patients with PACIs. CONCLUSIONS: An increased CCA-IMT as a marker
	of general atherosclerosis was associated with IBI and reflects cardiovascular
	risk. Carotid and coronary atherosclerosis were positively correlated
	with IBIs, with significant differences across the subtypes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major thrombotic and embolic complications of atherosclerosis
	are closely associated with irregularity and rupture of atheromatous
	plaques in both the carotid and coronary arteries. Plaque instability
	is partly determined by local factors, but systemic factors, such
	as infection, autoimmunity, or genes, may also be important. If plaque
	stability is influenced by systemic factors that are present in only
	a proportion of patients, some individuals should be more prone to
	rupture of plaques than others--ie, irregular plaques should occur
	in multiple vascular beds in some individuals more frequently than
	would be expected by chance alone. METHODS: We studied 5393 carotid
	bifurcation angiograms from 3007 patients with a recently symptomatic
	carotid stenosis. We assessed the extent to which plaque-surface
	irregularity at the symptomatic carotid artery was associated with
	irregularity at a distant site, the contralateral carotid artery,
	and the extent to which plaque irregularity at these sites was associated
	with previous myocardial infarction or subsequent non-stroke vascular
	death (due mainly to coronary-artery disease). FINDINGS: Patients
	with plaque-surface irregularity (n=1897) in the symptomatic carotid
	artery were more likely than those with smooth plaque (n=110) to
	have irregularity in the contralateral carotid artery (odds ratio
	2.21 [95\% CI 1.62-3.01], p<0.001). Patients with irregular plaques
	in both arteries were more likely to have had a previous myocardial
	infarction than patients with smooth plaques (hazard ratio 1.82 [1.23-2.64],
	p<0.001), and were more likely to have a non-stroke vascular death
	on follow-up (hazard ratio 1.67 [1.15-2.44], p=0.007). However, there
	was no difference in the risk of non-vascular death (hazard ratio
	0.92 [0.57-1.45], p=0.5). These associations were not explicable
	on the basis of differences in traditional vascular risk factors.
	INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that some individuals have a systemic
	predisposition to irregularity and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques
	that is independent of traditional vascular risk factors. This finding
	supports the hypothesis that other systemic factors are important
	in the cause of plaque instability.},

  abstract = {Epidemiologic studies have shown a clear comorbidity between migraine
	with aura and a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Under the age of 55,
	migraine with aura is a risk factor for ischemic stroke and a proportion
	of the latter is due to a PFO. It remains to be determined whether
	PFO is causally related to migraine attacks, or is a fortuitous association
	due to common genetic factors. Cortical spreading depression which
	is the underlying mechanism of the migrainous aura, could be favoured
	by a PFO. Several retrospective and uncontrolled studies suggest
	that percutaneous closure of a PFO for stroke or decompression illness
	in divers reduces frequency of migraine attacks with, but also without
	aura. Multicentric, prospective and controlled trials of this intervention
	in migraineurs are underway or in preparation. As long as their results
	are not known, there is no rationale for proposing PFO closure for
	migraine.},

  abstract = {Numerous epidemiologic observations reporting high prevalence of migraine
	among young individuals with stroke as well as dysfunction of cerebral
	arteries during migraine attacks prompt speculation on the existence
	of a comorbidity between the two disorders. The recent finding of
	silent infarct-like brain lesions in migraineurs reinforced this
	hypothesis and raised questions on whether migraine may be a progressive
	disorder rather than simply an episodic disorder. Stroke can occur
	during the course of migraine attacks with aura, supporting the assumption
	of a causal relation between the two diseases. Migraine may accentuate
	other existing risk factors for stroke, and both jointly increase
	the risk of cerebral ischemia outside of migraine attacks. In this
	regard, the role of migraine might be that of predisposing condition
	for cerebral ischemia. Migraine and ischemic stroke may be the end
	phenotype of common pathogenic mechanisms. Evidence of a migraine-stroke
	relation in cases of specific disorders, such as CADASIL (cerebral
	autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy)
	and MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis,
	and stroke-like episodes), strongly supports this concept. Finally,
	acute focal cerebral ischemia can trigger migraine attacks, and,
	thus, migraine may be the consequence of stroke. In this paper, we
	will review contemporary epidemiologic studies, discuss potential
	mechanisms of migraine-induced stroke and comorbid ischemic stroke,
	and pose new research questions.},
