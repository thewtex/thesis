  abstract = {Carotid artery occlusive disease is an important stroke risk factor
	and accounts for a significant proportion of stroke morbidity and
	mortality. In this article we survey the major clinical trials related
	to stroke risk in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients who have
	internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis; techniques for noninvasive
	screening of ICA stenosis including ultrasound, MR angiography, and
	CT angiography; and evolving algorithms for ICA evaluation. We comment
	on current interest in plaque morphology as a risk factor for stroke.},
