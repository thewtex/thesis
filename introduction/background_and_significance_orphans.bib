  abstract = {Carotid artery occlusive disease is an important stroke risk factor
	and accounts for a significant proportion of stroke morbidity and
	mortality. In this article we survey the major clinical trials related
	to stroke risk in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients who have
	internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis; techniques for noninvasive
	screening of ICA stenosis including ultrasound, MR angiography, and
	CT angiography; and evolving algorithms for ICA evaluation. We comment
	on current interest in plaque morphology as a risk factor for stroke.},

  title = {Current imaging modalities to visualize vulnerability within the
	atherosclerotic carotid plaque.},
  journal = {J Vasc Surg},
  year = {2008},
  month = {Sep},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that plaque vulnerability,
	rather than the degree of stenosis, is important in predicting the
	occurrence of subsequent cerebral ischemic events in patients with
	carotid artery stenosis. The many imaging modalities currently available
	have different properties with regard to the visualization of the
	extent of vulnerability in carotid plaque formation. METHODS: Original
	published studies were identified using the MEDLINE database (January
	1966 to March 2008). Manual cross-referencing was also performed.
	RESULTS: There is no single imaging modality that can produce definitive
	information about the state of vulnerability of an atherosclerotic
	plaque. Each has its own specific drawbacks, which may be the use
	of ionizing radiation or nephrotoxic contrast agents, an invasive
	character, low patient tolerability, or simply the paucity of information
	obtained on plaque vulnerability. Functional molecular imaging techniques
	such as positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission-computed
	tomography (SPECT) and near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) do seem
	able accurately to visualize and even quantify features of plaque
	vulnerability and its pathophysiologic processes. Promising new techniques
	like near infra-red fluorescence imaging are being developed and
	may be beneficial in this field. CONCLUSION: There is a promising
	role for functional molecular imaging modalities like PET, SPECT,
	or NIRS related to improvement of selection criteria for carotid
	intervention, especially when combined with CT or MRI to add further
	anatomical details to molecular information. Further information
	will be needed to define whether and where this functional molecular
	imaging will fit into a clinical strategy.},
