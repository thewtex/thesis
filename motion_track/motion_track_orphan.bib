  title = {2-D locally regularized tissue strain estimation from radio-frequency

  abstract = {In this paper, a 2-D locally regularized strain estimation method
	for imaging deformation of soft biological tissues from radio-frequency
	(RF) ultrasound (US) data is introduced. Contrary to most 2-D techniques
	that model the compression-induced local displacement as a 2-D shift,
	our algorithm also considers a local scaling factor in the axial
	direction. This direction-dependent model of tissue motion and deformation
	is induced by the highly anisotropic resolution of RF US images.
	Optimal parameters are computed through the constrained maximization
	of a similarity criterion defined as the normalized correlation coefficient.
	Its value at the solution is then used as an indicator of estimation
	reliability, the probability of correct estimation increasing with
	the correlation value. In case of correlation loss, the estimation
	integrates an additional constraint, imposing local continuity within
	displacement and strain fields. Using local scaling factors and regularization
	increase the method's robustness with regard to decorrelation noise,
	resulting in a wider range of precise measurements. Results on simulated
	US data from a mechanically homogeneous medium subjected to successive
	uniaxial loadings demonstrate that our method is theoretically able
	to accurately estimate strains up to 17\%. Experimental strain images
	of phantom and cut specimens of bovine liver clearly show the harder
	inclusions.},
