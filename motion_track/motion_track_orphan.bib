  abstract = {In this paper, a 2-D locally regularized strain estimation method
	for imaging deformation of soft biological tissues from radio-frequency
	(RF) ultrasound (US) data is introduced. Contrary to most 2-D techniques
	that model the compression-induced local displacement as a 2-D shift,
	our algorithm also considers a local scaling factor in the axial
	direction. This direction-dependent model of tissue motion and deformation
	is induced by the highly anisotropic resolution of RF US images.
	Optimal parameters are computed through the constrained maximization
	of a similarity criterion defined as the normalized correlation coefficient.
	Its value at the solution is then used as an indicator of estimation
	reliability, the probability of correct estimation increasing with
	the correlation value. In case of correlation loss, the estimation
	integrates an additional constraint, imposing local continuity within
	displacement and strain fields. Using local scaling factors and regularization
	increase the method's robustness with regard to decorrelation noise,
	resulting in a wider range of precise measurements. Results on simulated
	US data from a mechanically homogeneous medium subjected to successive
	uniaxial loadings demonstrate that our method is theoretically able
	to accurately estimate strains up to 17\%. Experimental strain images
	of phantom and cut specimens of bovine liver clearly show the harder
	inclusions.},

	of correlation-based time delay measurements. In strain imaging,
	companding is applied to warp 2-D or 3-D ultrasonic echo fields to
	improve coherence between data acquired before and after compression.
	It minimizes decorrelation errors, which are the dominant source
	of strain image noise. The word refers to a spatially variable signal
	scaling that compresses and expands waveforms acquired in an ultrasonic
	scan plane or volume. Temporal stretching by the applied strain is
	a single-scale (global), 1-D companding process that has been used
	successfully to reduce strain noise. This paper describes a two-scale
	(global and local), 2-D companding technique that is based on a sum-absolute-difference
	(SAD) algorithm for blood velocity estimation. Several experiments
	are presented that demonstrate improvements in target visibility
	for strain imaging. The results show that, if tissue motion can be
	confined to the scan plane of a linear array transducer, displacement
	variance can be reduced two orders of magnitude using 2-D local companding

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Uncertainty often affects molecular biology experiments
	and data for different reasons. Heterogeneity of gene or protein
	expression within the same tumor tissue is an example of biological
	uncertainty which should be taken into account when molecular markers
	are used in decision making. Tissue Microarray (TMA) experiments
	allow for large scale profiling of tissue biopsies, investigating
	protein patterns characterizing specific disease states. TMA studies
	deal with multiple sampling of the same patient, and therefore with
	multiple measurements of same protein target, to account for possible
	biological heterogeneity. The aim of this paper is to provide and
	validate a classification model taking into consideration the uncertainty
	associated with measuring replicate samples.RESULTS:We propose an
	extension of the well-known Naive Bayes classifier, which accounts
	for biological heterogeneity in a probabilistic framework, relying
	on Bayesian hierarchical models. The model, which can be efficiently
	learned from the training dataset, exploits a closed-form of classification
	equation, thus providing no additional computational cost with respect
	to the standard Naive Bayes classifier. We validated the approach
	on several simulated datasets comparing its performances with the
	Naive Bayes classifier. Moreover, we demonstrated that explicitly
	dealing with heterogeneity can improve classification accuracy on
	a TMA prostate cancer dataset.CONCLUSION:The proposed Hierarchical
	Naive Bayes classifier can be conveniently applied in problems where
	within sample heterogeneity must be taken into account, such as TMA
	experiments and biological contexts where several measurements (replicates)
	are available for the same biological sample. The performance of
	the new approach is better than the standard Naive Bayes model, in
	particular when the within sample heterogeneity is different in the
	different classes.},

  month = {Sep},
  abstract = {Patient-specific biomechanical modeling of atherosclerotic arteries
	has the potential to aid clinicians in characterizing lesions and
	determining optimal treatment plans. To attain high levels of accuracy,
	recent models use medical imaging data to determine plaque component
	boundaries in three dimensions, and fluid-structure interaction is
	used to capture mechanical loading of the diseased vessel. As the
	plaque components and vessel wall are often highly complex in shape,
	constructing a suitable structured computational mesh is very challenging
	and can require a great deal of time. Models based on unstructured
	computational meshes require relatively less time to construct and
	are capable of accurately representing plaque components in three
	dimensions. These models unfortunately require additional computational
	resources and computing time for accurate and meaningful results.
	A two-stage modeling strategy based on unstructured computational
	meshes is proposed to achieve a reasonable balance between meshing
	difficulty and computational resource and time demand. In this method,
	a coarsegrained simulation of the full arterial domain is used to
	guide and constrain a fine-scale simulation of a smaller region of
	interest within the full domain. Results for a patient-specific carotid
	bifurcation model demonstrate that the two-stage approach can afford
	a large savings in both time for mesh generation and time and resources
	needed for computation. The effects of solid and fluid domain truncation
	were explored, and were shown to minimally affect accuracy of the
	stress fields predicted with the two-stage approach.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates a new approach devoted to displacement vector
	estimation in ultrasound imaging. The main idea is to adapt the image
	formation to a given displacement estimation method to increase the
	precision of the estimation. The displacement is identified as the
	zero crossing of the phase of the complex cross-correlation between
	signals extracted from the lateral direction of the ultrasound RF
	image. For precise displacement estimation, a linearity of the phase
	slope is needed as well as a high phase slope. Consequently, a particular
	point spread function (PSF) dedicated to this estimator is designed.
	This PSF, showing oscillations in the lateral direction, leads to
	synthesis of lateral RF signals. The estimation is included in a
	2-D displacement vector estimation method. The improvement of this
	approach is evaluated quantitatively by simulation studies. A comparison
	with a speckle tracking technique is also presented. The lateral
	oscillations improve both the speckle tracking estimation and our
	2-D estimation method. Using our dedicated images, the precision
	of the estimation is improved by reducing the standard deviation
	of the lateral displacement error by a factor of 2 for speckle tracking
	and more than 3 with our method compared to using conventional images.
	Our method performs 7 times better than speckle tracking. Experimentally,
	the improvement in the case of a pure lateral translation reaches
	a factor of 7. Finally, the experimental feasibility of the 2-D displacement
	vector estimation is demonstrated on data acquired from a Cryogel
	phantom.},

	an estimation of a coarse displacement estimate utilizing B-mode

	estimates are obtained starting from down-sampled B-mode pre- and

	The coarse displacement estimate obtained from the B-mode data is

	The ultimate strength in uniaxial tension was taken as the peak stress

  abstract = {Invasive procedures to revascularize occluded blood vessels rely on
	the mechanical response of the diseased tissue. Failure rates associated
	with such procedures show the need for improvement. to understand
	the associated mechanics, the material properties of atherosclerotic
	plaque should be known; yet data are scant. The purpose of this study
	was to investigate the different mechanical responses exhibited by
	plaques with different compositions, focusing specifically on radial
	compressive behavior. A custom-built experimental system was developed
	that was fully computer controlled with a broad range of loading
	capabilities. A temperature-controlled, physiologic specimen bath
	allowed testing at 37 degrees C. Monotonically loaded specimens showed
	that plaque behavior was nonlinear under finite deformations. A multiple
	cycle protocol, executed in two phases, distinguished three types
	of mechanical response of different plaques. The differences in behavior
	were associated with histologic differences in plaque composition,
	and mechanically characterized by different ''repeatability'' (the
	stabilization of the cyclic response) and ''recoverability'' (the
	second loading phase retracing the first loading phase behavior).
	Type 1 behavior was categorized by repeatability and recoverability
	. Type 2 behavior displayed repeatability but only partial recovery
	during the second loading phase. Recovery was absent in type 3 behavior.
	The histologic observations demonstrated that calcified tissue was
	present only in specimens displaying type 1 behavior. Fibrous tissue
	and part of a modified media (due to disease) were present in specimens
	displaying type 2 behavior. An atheroma, along with a relatively
	thin modified media, was present in specimens displaying type 3 behavior.
	The differences in the maximum stretches attained at the end of phase
	I loading, the stretch offset from the first to the 15th cycle of
	phase I loading, and the hysteresis in the first and 15th cycles
	of phase I loading distinguished the specimen behaviors with statistical
	significance. These compression data showed that plaques exhibit
	composition- and history-dependent nonlinear and inelastic responses
	under finite deformations. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {A multilevel motion model-based approach to ultrasonic speckle tracking
	has been developed that addresses the inherent trade-offs associated
	with traditional single-level block matching (SLBM) methods. The
	multilevel block matching (MLBM) algorithm uses variable matching
	block and search window sizes in a coarse-to-fine scheme, preserving
	the relative immunity to noise associated with the use of a large
	matching block while preserving the motion field detail associated
	with the use of a small matching block. To decrease further the sensitivity
	of the multilevel approach to noise, speckle decorrelation and false
	matches, a smooth motion model-based block matching (SMBM) algorithm
	has been implemented that takes into account the spatial inertia
	of soft tissue elements. The new algorithms were compared to SLBM
	through a series of experiments involving manual translation of soft
	tissue phantoms, motion field computer simulations of rotation, compression
	and shear deformation, and an experiment involving contraction of
	human forearm muscles. Measures of tracking accuracy included mean
	squared tracking error, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and blinded
	observations of optical flow. Measures of tracking efficiency included
	the number of sum squared difference calculations and the computation
	time. In the phantom translation experiments, the SMBM algorithm
	successfully matched the accuracy of SLBM using both large and small
	matching blocks while significantly reducing the number of computations
	and computation time when a large matching block was used. For the
	computer simulations, SMBM yielded better tracking accuracies and
	spatial resolution when compared with SLBM using a large matching
	block. For the muscle experiment, SMBM outperformed SLBM both in
	terms of PSNR and observations of optical flow. We believe that the
	smooth motion model-based MLBM approach represents a meaningful development
	in ultrasonic soft tissue motion measurement. (C) 1998 World Federation
