  abstract = {The goal of this study was to develop methods for quantitative ultrasound
	imagery suitable for noninvasive assessment of carotid plaque composition
	prior to the selection of the technique for revascularization. Using
	two broadband transducers (5-12 MHz and 12-28 MHz), backscattered
	radio frequency signals were acquired from entire lengths of 15 carotid
	endarterectomy specimens. Spectral analysis methods with correction
	for system response and beam diffraction were applied to radio frequency
	signals from local volumes of plaque having a 2 mm slice thickness,
	1 mm width and axial depth of 480 microm and 240 microm at 10 MHz
	and 20 MHz, respectively. From these spectra, local values of four
	ultrasound parameters (integrated backscatter, frequency dependence
	of backscatter, integrated attenuation and slope of attenuation)
	were estimated and used to construct quantitative images. To combine
	information from these different parameter images, a two-step approach
	was followed. First, in 59 independent quantitative images of highly
	stenotic plaque, the average parameter values in a central five-by-three
	pixel region were correlated with plaque composition as assessed
	by histology to investigate the relationship between parameter values,
	frequency bandwidth and plaque composition. Discriminant analysis
	of parameter values vs. plaque composition was made to find a set
	of predictive equations to classify sets of measurements. Correct
	classification was obtained for 100\% of calcified, 75\% of intraplaque
	hemorrhage and 71\% of lipidic plaques of the input data set. Second,
	each set of pixels from different parameter images was classified
	using the predictive equations, and a single, local tissue composition
	image was constructed. Examples of tissue composition images are
	presented in comparison with corresponding histologic sections. Both
	agreement and disagreement between image pairs are discussed.},

  abstract = {A review was undertaken of physical phenomena and the values of associated
	physical quantities relevant to arterial ultrasound imaging and measurement.
	Arteries are multilayered anisotropic structures. However, the requirement
	to obtain elasticity measurements from the data available using ultrasound
	imaging necessitates the use of highly simplified constitutive models
	involving Young's modulus, E. Values of E are reported for healthy
	arteries and for the constituents of diseased arteries. It is widely
	assumed that arterial blood flow is Newtonian. However, recent studies
	suggest that non-Newtonian behavior has a strong influence on arterial
	flow, and the balance of published evidence suggests that non-Newtonian
	behavior is associated primarily with red cell deformation rather
	than with aggregation. Hence, modeling studies should account for
	red cell deformation and the shear thinning effect that this produces.
	Published literature in healthy adults gives an average hematocrit
	and high-shear viscosity of 0.44 +/- 0.03 and 3.9 +/- 0.6 mPa.s,
	respectively. Published data on the acoustic properties of arteries
	and blood is sufficiently consistent between papers to allow compilation
	and derivation of best-fit equations summarizing the behavior across
	a wide frequency range, which then may be used in future modeling
	studies. Best-fit equations were derived for the attenuation coefficient
	vs. frequency in whole arteries (R2 = 0.995), plasma (R2 = 0.963)
	and blood with hematocrit near 45% (R2 = 0.999), and for the backscatter
