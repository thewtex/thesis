	two broadband transducers (5-12 MHz and 12-28 MHz), backscattered
	radio frequency signals were acquired from entire lengths of 15 carotid
	endarterectomy specimens. Spectral analysis methods with correction
	for system response and beam diffraction were applied to radio frequency
	signals from local volumes of plaque having a 2 mm slice thickness,
	1 mm width and axial depth of 480 microm and 240 microm at 10 MHz
	and 20 MHz, respectively. From these spectra, local values of four
	ultrasound parameters (integrated backscatter, frequency dependence
	of backscatter, integrated attenuation and slope of attenuation)
	were estimated and used to construct quantitative images. To combine
	information from these different parameter images, a two-step approach
	was followed. First, in 59 independent quantitative images of highly
	stenotic plaque, the average parameter values in a central five-by-three
	pixel region were correlated with plaque composition as assessed
	by histology to investigate the relationship between parameter values,
	frequency bandwidth and plaque composition. Discriminant analysis

	of predictive equations to classify sets of measurements. Correct
	classification was obtained for 100\% of calcified, 75\% of intraplaque
	hemorrhage and 71\% of lipidic plaques of the input data set. Second,
	each set of pixels from different parameter images was classified
	using the predictive equations, and a single, local tissue composition
	image was constructed. Examples of tissue composition images are
	presented in comparison with corresponding histologic sections. Both
	agreement and disagreement between image pairs are discussed.},

  abstract = {A review was undertaken of physical phenomena and the values of associated
	physical quantities relevant to arterial ultrasound imaging and measurement.
	Arteries are multilayered anisotropic structures. However, the requirement
	to obtain elasticity measurements from the data available using ultrasound
	imaging necessitates the use of highly simplified constitutive models
	involving Young's modulus, E. Values of E are reported for healthy
	arteries and for the constituents of diseased arteries. It is widely
	assumed that arterial blood flow is Newtonian. However, recent studies
	suggest that non-Newtonian behavior has a strong influence on arterial
	flow, and the balance of published evidence suggests that non-Newtonian
	behavior is associated primarily with red cell deformation rather
	than with aggregation. Hence, modeling studies should account for
	red cell deformation and the shear thinning effect that this produces.
	Published literature in healthy adults gives an average hematocrit
	and high-shear viscosity of 0.44 +/- 0.03 and 3.9 +/- 0.6 mPa.s,
	respectively. Published data on the acoustic properties of arteries
	and blood is sufficiently consistent between papers to allow compilation
	and derivation of best-fit equations summarizing the behavior across
	a wide frequency range, which then may be used in future modeling
	studies. Best-fit equations were derived for the attenuation coefficient

	into 5 categories, compared with each of the plaque histologies:
	category 1 (thrombus), -88 < IB < or = -80; category 2 (intimal hyperplasia
	or lipid core), -73 < IB < or = -63; category 3 (fibrous tissue),
	-63 < IB < or = -55; category 4 (mixed lesions), -55 < IB < or =
	-30; and category 5 (calcification), -30 < IB < or = -23. On the
	basis of these categories, we analyzed 5120 ROIs per segment in each
	ring-like arterial specimen. Color-coded maps of plaques were constructed
	by use of these IB data and conventional IVUS data, which reflected
	the plaque histology of autopsied coronary arteries well. Then, the
	same method was undertaken in 24 segments with plaque from 12 patients
	in vivo with angina pectoris. Comparisons between coronary angioscopy
	and IB-IVUS revealed that the surface color of plaques in angioscopy
	reflected the thickness of the fibrous cap rather than the size of
	the lipid core. CONCLUSIONS: IB-IVUS represents a new and useful
	tool for evaluating the tissue structure of human coronary arterial
	plaques.},

  abstract = {Attenuation estimation methods for medical ultrasound are important
	because attenuation properties of soft tissue can be used to distinguish
	between benign and malignant tumors and to detect diffuse disease.
	The classical spectral shift method and the spectral difference method
	are the most commonly used methods for the estimation of the attenuation;
	however, they both have specific limitations. Classical spectral
	shift approaches for estimating ultrasonic attenuation are more sensitive
	to local spectral noise artifacts and have difficulty in compensating
	for diffraction effects because of beam focusing. Spectral difference
	approaches, on the other hand, fail to accurately estimate attenuation
	coefficient values at tissue boundaries that also possess variations
	in the backscatter. In this paper, we propose a hybrid attenuation
	estimation method that combines the advantages of the spectral difference
	and spectral shift methods to overcome their specific limitations.
	The proposed hybrid method initially uses the spectral difference
	approach to reduce the impact of system-dependent parameters including
	diffraction effects. The normalized power spectrum that includes
	variations because of backscatter changes is then filtered using
	a Gaussian filter centered at the transmit center frequency of the
	system. A spectral shift method, namely the spectral cross-correlation
	algorithm is then used to compute spectral shifts from these filtered
	power spectra to estimate the attenuation coefficient. Ultrasound
	simulation results demonstrate that the estimation accuracy of the
	hybrid method is better than the centroid downshift method (spectral
	shift method), in uniformly attenuating regions. In addition, this
	method is also stable at boundaries with variations in the backscatter
	when compared with the reference phantom method (spectral difference
	method). Experimental results using tissue-mimicking phantom also
	illustrate that the hybrid method is more robust and provides accurate
	attenuation estimates in both uniformly attenuating regions and across
	boundaries with backscatter variations. The proposed hybrid method
	preserves the advantages of both the spectral shift and spectral
	difference approaches while eliminating the disadvantages associated
	with each of these methods, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness
	of the attenuation estimation.},

	(IVUS) cannot accurately differentiate histologic subtypes of sonolucent
	coronary plaques with or without a lipid core. METHODS: We analyzed
	radiofrequency signals obtained in vitro from 24 regions of interest
	(ROI) of noncalcified (sonolucent) plaques in 10 atherosclerotic
	coronary artery specimens pressure-fixed by formalin. Radiofrequency
	signals were sampled with a 30-MHz IVUS catheter and digitized at
	500 MHz in 8-bit resolution. The ROIs were histologically categorized
	into 12 plaques with a lipid core and 12 plaques without it. Integrated
	backscatter and statistical parameters of the radiofrequency envelope
	(mean/SD ratio [MSR], skewness, and kurtosis) within the ROI were
	calculated offline, and their ability to detect a lipid core was
	compared with visual analysis of the IVUS video images. In the group
	with lipid cores, percent area of a lipid core in each ROI was measured
	in a digitized histologic image by a computerized planimeter. RESULTS:
	Sensitivity and specificity of MSR, skewness, and kurtosis for lipid
	core detection were substantially greater than visual video image
	analysis (83.3\% and 91.7\%, 100\% and 91.7\%, 100\% and 91.7\% vs
	53.3\% and 71.7\%). Furthermore, the parameters of integrated backscatter,
	MSR, skewness, and kurtosis were significantly correlated to percent
	of core area (r = -0.64, -0.73, 0.78, and 0.63, respectively; P<.05).
	CONCLUSIONS: Compared with IVUS video images, the parameters of radiofrequency
	signal analysis may be used to aid in more accurate detection and
	quantitative evaluation of a lipid core, which is one of the major
	factors of a vulnerable coronary plaque.},

	processes as compensatory enlargement of the coronary artery has
	focused diagnostic interest on the non-stenotic lesions of the coronary
	tree. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) can reveal discrepancies between
	the extent of coronary atherosclerosis and angiography imaging by

	(RF) data enables a more detailed analysis of plaque composition
	and morphology. Preliminary in vitro studies correlated four histological

  abstract = {A 50 MHz ultrasound backscatter microscope has been built to measure
	the acoustic properties of vascular tissues and blood over the frequency
	range from 35-65 MHz. High resolution (45 microns) ultrasound backscatter
	microscope images of nine femoral and eight common carotid human
	artery samples were made and compared with corresponding histological
	sections. Individual tissue layers were selected using these images
	for quantitative measurement of the frequency dependent backscatter.
	Backscatter measurements were made in each layer of an artery at
	two different angles of incidence: along the axis of the artery (axial
	direction) and at 90 degrees to this measurement radially out from
	the center of the artery (radial direction). Scattering was found
	to be higher in elastic arteries (carotid) than in the muscular arteries
	(femoral). The largest difference was found in the media where the
	average scatter (measured in the radial direction at 50 MHz) increased
	from 0.002 sr-1 mm-1 in muscular arteries to 0.4 sr-1 mm-1 in elastic
	arteries. Large differences in scattering between measurements made
	in the axial and radial direction were also found. Again, the largest
	differences were found in the media where scattering (at 50 MHz)
	in carotid arteries increased from 0.003 sr-1 mm-1 measured in the
	axial direction to 0.4 sr-1 mm-1 measured in the radial direction.
	The speed of sound and attenuation in the artery wall of each sample

	1579-1628 ms-1. The average attenuation in the artery wall increased
	from 4 dB mm-1 at 30 MHz to 10 dB mm-1 at 60 mHz. This is higher
	than the attenuation measured in blood which increased from 1.6 dB
	mm-1 to 5 dB mm-1 over the same frequency range. The backscatter

	to 36 cms-1. At flow velocities below 18 cms-1 a level of scattering
	of 0.0005 sr-1 mm-1 (at 50 MHz) was found. An increase in scattering

  abstract = {Coronary artery disease is the number one cause of death in the United
	States and the Western world, and approximately 250,000 affected
	people die per year without ever being admitted to a hospital. One
	of the main reasons of such a high death-rate without any diagnosis
	is that more than 50 or heart-attacks) occur in patients with no
	prior history of known heart disease or symptoms. Coronary artery
	disease leads to the occlusion of arteries that are vital in providing
	nutrients to the heart muscles. The disease develops by progressive
	accumulation or formation of "plaque" within an artery. Certain types
	of plaques could occlude blood flow and yet might be "stable". These
	plaques usually have a high fibrous content, and are known as hard
	plaques. On the other hand, "unstable" or "soft" plaques might not
	cause much occlusion but could be vulnerable to rupture. Rupture
	of such plaques could lead to total or partial occlusion in arteries
	resulting in sudden cardiac death or heart-attack. In fact, 68 coronary
	arteries are less than 50.Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a minimally
	invasive imaging modality that provides cross-section images of arteries
	in real-time, allowing visualization of atherosclerotic plaques in
	vivo. In standard IVUS gray-scale images, calcified regions of plaque
	and dense fibrous components generally reflect ultrasound energy
	well and thus appear bright and homogeneous on IVUS images. Conversely,
	regions of low echo reflectance in IVUS images are usually labeled
	"soft" or "mixed" plaque. However, this visual interpretation has
	been demonstrated to be very inconsistent in accurately determining
	plaque composition and does not allow real-time assessment of quantitative
	plaque constituents.Spectral analysis of the backscattered radiofrequency
	(RF) ultrasound signals allows detailed assessment of plaque composition.
	Advanced mathematical techniques can be employed to extract spectral
	information from these RF data to determine composition. The spectral
	content or signature of RF data reflected from tissue depends on
	density, compressibility, concentration, size, etc. A combination
	of spectral parameters were used to develop statistical classification
	schemes for analysis of in vivo IVUS data in real-time. The clinical
	data acquisition system is ECG gated and the analysis software developed
	by our group reconstructs IVUS gray-scale images from the acquired
	RF data. A combination of spectral parameters and active contour
	models is used for real-time 3D plaque segmentation followed by computation
	of color-coded tissue maps for each image cross-section and longitudinal
	views of the entire vessel. The "fly-through" mode allows one to
	visualize the complete length of the artery internally with the histology
	components at the lumen surface. In addition, vessel and plaque metrics
	such as areas and volumes of individual plaque components (collagen,
	fibro-lipid, calcium, lipid-core) are also available.},

	The remaining data were used to assess the accuracy of the CTs. The

	following carotid stenting and the completion angiogram to detect
	evidence of inaccurate stent deployment. Axial 2D views were used

	plaques before acute coronary syndrome (ACS) by use of integrated
	backscatter intravascular ultrasound (IB-IVUS). BACKGROUND: Tissue
	characterization of coronary plaques is possible with the use of
	IB-IVUS. METHODS: The subjects were 140 patients with angina pectoris,
	and we selected 160 coronary lesions without significant stenosis
	for evaluation. Ultrasound signals were obtained by an IVUS system
	using a 40-MHz catheter. RESULTS: At the follow-up (30 +/- 7 months),
	12 plaques caused ACS after the initial IVUS examination. Ten of
	the 12 plaques had IVUS parameters recorded at baseline. These 10
	plaques were classified as vulnerable plaques (VP), and the other
	plaques were classified as stable plaques (SP; n = 143). There was
	no significant difference of vessel area, lumen area, and plaque
	area between VP and SP. However, plaque burden (60 +/- 9\% vs. 52
	+/- 9\%; p = 0.014), eccentricity (0.70 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.55 +/- 0.17;
	p = 0.013), remodeling index (1.30 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.16; p
	= 0.006) and percentage lipid area (72 +/- 10\% vs. 50 +/- 16\%;
	p < 0.0001) were greater in VP than in SP. Percentage fibrous area
	(23 +/- 6\% vs. 47 +/- 14\%; p < 0.0001) was smaller in VP than in
	SP. The sensitivities, specificities, and positive predictive values
	of percentage fibrous area (90\%, 96\%, and 69\%, respectively) and
	percentage lipid area (80\%, 90\%, and 42\%, respectively) for classifying
	VP were evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue characteristics of VP before
	ACS were different from those of SP. This suggests that VP and SP
	as classified by IB-IVUS are useful in predicting ACS.},
