	parametric images were constructed from the integrated (30 to 50
	MHz) backscatter and attenuation obtained using FFT methods with
	diffraction correction and a multinarrow-band attenuation algorithm.
	Parametric magnetic resonance images were constructed from calculated
	values of the transverse relaxation time T2 determined from an 8
	echo-single-slice sequence at 3 Tesla. In a total of 54 regions of
	interest, average values of integrated attenuation, integrated backscatter
	compensated for the attenuation between the artery surface and the

	with local tissue composition as assessed by histology. Results show

  abstract = {The goal of this study was to develop methods for quantitative ultrasound
	imagery suitable for noninvasive assessment of carotid plaque composition
	prior to the selection of the technique for revascularization. Using
	two broadband transducers (5-12 MHz and 12-28 MHz), backscattered
	radio frequency signals were acquired from entire lengths of 15 carotid
	endarterectomy specimens. Spectral analysis methods with correction
	for system response and beam diffraction were applied to radio frequency
	signals from local volumes of plaque having a 2 mm slice thickness,
	1 mm width and axial depth of 480 microm and 240 microm at 10 MHz
	and 20 MHz, respectively. From these spectra, local values of four
	ultrasound parameters (integrated backscatter, frequency dependence
	of backscatter, integrated attenuation and slope of attenuation)
	were estimated and used to construct quantitative images. To combine
	information from these different parameter images, a two-step approach
	was followed. First, in 59 independent quantitative images of highly
	stenotic plaque, the average parameter values in a central five-by-three
	pixel region were correlated with plaque composition as assessed
	by histology to investigate the relationship between parameter values,
	frequency bandwidth and plaque composition. Discriminant analysis
	of parameter values vs. plaque composition was made to find a set
	of predictive equations to classify sets of measurements. Correct
	classification was obtained for 100\% of calcified, 75\% of intraplaque
	hemorrhage and 71\% of lipidic plaques of the input data set. Second,
	each set of pixels from different parameter images was classified
	using the predictive equations, and a single, local tissue composition
	image was constructed. Examples of tissue composition images are
	presented in comparison with corresponding histologic sections. Both
	agreement and disagreement between image pairs are discussed.},

	high-frequency intravascular ultrasound could provide a basis for

	local measurements of quantitative ultrasonic parameters in a conventional

	their clinical utility. Toward this goal, the apparent integrated
	backscatter, the slope of attenuation (25-56 MHz) and the value of
	the attenuation on the linear fit at 37.5 MHz were measured using
	the backscattered radio frequency signals from in vitro human aortae.
	Local estimations of these ultrasonic parameters from both normal
	and atherosclerotic aortic segments were displayed in a B-scan format.
	The morphological features of these parametric images corresponded
	well to features of histological images of the same regions. The
	attenuation from 25-56 MHz of seven segments of the medial layer
	(both with and without overlying atheroma) were measured using the
	multinarrow-band backscatter method. The average attenuation in the
	media at 24 degrees C +/- 3 degrees C was 45 +/- 16 dB/cm at 25 MHz
