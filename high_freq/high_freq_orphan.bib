	two broadband transducers (5-12 MHz and 12-28 MHz), backscattered
	radio frequency signals were acquired from entire lengths of 15 carotid
	endarterectomy specimens. Spectral analysis methods with correction
	for system response and beam diffraction were applied to radio frequency
	signals from local volumes of plaque having a 2 mm slice thickness,
	1 mm width and axial depth of 480 microm and 240 microm at 10 MHz
	and 20 MHz, respectively. From these spectra, local values of four
	ultrasound parameters (integrated backscatter, frequency dependence
	of backscatter, integrated attenuation and slope of attenuation)
	were estimated and used to construct quantitative images. To combine
	information from these different parameter images, a two-step approach
	was followed. First, in 59 independent quantitative images of highly
	stenotic plaque, the average parameter values in a central five-by-three
	pixel region were correlated with plaque composition as assessed
	by histology to investigate the relationship between parameter values,
	frequency bandwidth and plaque composition. Discriminant analysis

	of predictive equations to classify sets of measurements. Correct
	classification was obtained for 100\% of calcified, 75\% of intraplaque
	hemorrhage and 71\% of lipidic plaques of the input data set. Second,
	each set of pixels from different parameter images was classified
	using the predictive equations, and a single, local tissue composition
	image was constructed. Examples of tissue composition images are
	presented in comparison with corresponding histologic sections. Both
	agreement and disagreement between image pairs are discussed.},

  abstract = {A review was undertaken of physical phenomena and the values of associated
	physical quantities relevant to arterial ultrasound imaging and measurement.
	Arteries are multilayered anisotropic structures. However, the requirement
	to obtain elasticity measurements from the data available using ultrasound
	imaging necessitates the use of highly simplified constitutive models
	involving Young's modulus, E. Values of E are reported for healthy
	arteries and for the constituents of diseased arteries. It is widely
	assumed that arterial blood flow is Newtonian. However, recent studies
	suggest that non-Newtonian behavior has a strong influence on arterial
	flow, and the balance of published evidence suggests that non-Newtonian
	behavior is associated primarily with red cell deformation rather
	than with aggregation. Hence, modeling studies should account for
	red cell deformation and the shear thinning effect that this produces.
	Published literature in healthy adults gives an average hematocrit
	and high-shear viscosity of 0.44 +/- 0.03 and 3.9 +/- 0.6 mPa.s,
	respectively. Published data on the acoustic properties of arteries
	and blood is sufficiently consistent between papers to allow compilation
	and derivation of best-fit equations summarizing the behavior across
	a wide frequency range, which then may be used in future modeling
	studies. Best-fit equations were derived for the attenuation coefficient

	into 5 categories, compared with each of the plaque histologies:
	category 1 (thrombus), -88 < IB < or = -80; category 2 (intimal hyperplasia
	or lipid core), -73 < IB < or = -63; category 3 (fibrous tissue),
	-63 < IB < or = -55; category 4 (mixed lesions), -55 < IB < or =
	-30; and category 5 (calcification), -30 < IB < or = -23. On the
	basis of these categories, we analyzed 5120 ROIs per segment in each
	ring-like arterial specimen. Color-coded maps of plaques were constructed
	by use of these IB data and conventional IVUS data, which reflected
	the plaque histology of autopsied coronary arteries well. Then, the
	same method was undertaken in 24 segments with plaque from 12 patients
	in vivo with angina pectoris. Comparisons between coronary angioscopy
	and IB-IVUS revealed that the surface color of plaques in angioscopy
	reflected the thickness of the fibrous cap rather than the size of
	the lipid core. CONCLUSIONS: IB-IVUS represents a new and useful
	tool for evaluating the tissue structure of human coronary arterial
	plaques.},

  abstract = {Attenuation estimation methods for medical ultrasound are important
	because attenuation properties of soft tissue can be used to distinguish
	between benign and malignant tumors and to detect diffuse disease.
	The classical spectral shift method and the spectral difference method
	are the most commonly used methods for the estimation of the attenuation;
	however, they both have specific limitations. Classical spectral
	shift approaches for estimating ultrasonic attenuation are more sensitive
	to local spectral noise artifacts and have difficulty in compensating
	for diffraction effects because of beam focusing. Spectral difference
	approaches, on the other hand, fail to accurately estimate attenuation
	coefficient values at tissue boundaries that also possess variations
	in the backscatter. In this paper, we propose a hybrid attenuation
	estimation method that combines the advantages of the spectral difference
	and spectral shift methods to overcome their specific limitations.
	The proposed hybrid method initially uses the spectral difference
	approach to reduce the impact of system-dependent parameters including
	diffraction effects. The normalized power spectrum that includes
	variations because of backscatter changes is then filtered using
	a Gaussian filter centered at the transmit center frequency of the
	system. A spectral shift method, namely the spectral cross-correlation
	algorithm is then used to compute spectral shifts from these filtered
	power spectra to estimate the attenuation coefficient. Ultrasound
	simulation results demonstrate that the estimation accuracy of the
	hybrid method is better than the centroid downshift method (spectral
	shift method), in uniformly attenuating regions. In addition, this
	method is also stable at boundaries with variations in the backscatter
	when compared with the reference phantom method (spectral difference
	method). Experimental results using tissue-mimicking phantom also
	illustrate that the hybrid method is more robust and provides accurate
	attenuation estimates in both uniformly attenuating regions and across
	boundaries with backscatter variations. The proposed hybrid method
	preserves the advantages of both the spectral shift and spectral
	difference approaches while eliminating the disadvantages associated
	with each of these methods, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness
	of the attenuation estimation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Conventional gray-scale images of intravascular ultrasound
	(IVUS) cannot accurately differentiate histologic subtypes of sonolucent
	coronary plaques with or without a lipid core. METHODS: We analyzed
	radiofrequency signals obtained in vitro from 24 regions of interest
	(ROI) of noncalcified (sonolucent) plaques in 10 atherosclerotic
	coronary artery specimens pressure-fixed by formalin. Radiofrequency
	signals were sampled with a 30-MHz IVUS catheter and digitized at
	500 MHz in 8-bit resolution. The ROIs were histologically categorized
	into 12 plaques with a lipid core and 12 plaques without it. Integrated
	backscatter and statistical parameters of the radiofrequency envelope
	(mean/SD ratio [MSR], skewness, and kurtosis) within the ROI were
	calculated offline, and their ability to detect a lipid core was
	compared with visual analysis of the IVUS video images. In the group
	with lipid cores, percent area of a lipid core in each ROI was measured
	in a digitized histologic image by a computerized planimeter. RESULTS:
	Sensitivity and specificity of MSR, skewness, and kurtosis for lipid
	core detection were substantially greater than visual video image
	analysis (83.3\% and 91.7\%, 100\% and 91.7\%, 100\% and 91.7\% vs
	53.3\% and 71.7\%). Furthermore, the parameters of integrated backscatter,
	MSR, skewness, and kurtosis were significantly correlated to percent
	of core area (r = -0.64, -0.73, 0.78, and 0.63, respectively; P<.05).
	CONCLUSIONS: Compared with IVUS video images, the parameters of radiofrequency
	signal analysis may be used to aid in more accurate detection and
	quantitative evaluation of a lipid core, which is one of the major
	factors of a vulnerable coronary plaque.},

  abstract = {As a luminogram, coronary angiography provides a good overview of
	the coronary artery tree. Using quantitative coronary measurements,
	the degree of coronary obstruction can be determined. The limitation
	of coronary angiography is that it does not provide information on
	the arterial wall structure and therefore cannot assess the extent
	of atherosclerosis. Knowledge about adaptive coronary remodelling
	processes as compensatory enlargement of the coronary artery has
	focused diagnostic interest on the non-stenotic lesions of the coronary
	tree. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) can reveal discrepancies between
	the extent of coronary atherosclerosis and angiography imaging by
	in vivo plaque imaging. Spectrum analysis of IVUS-derived radiofrequency
	(RF) data enables a more detailed analysis of plaque composition
	and morphology. Preliminary in vitro studies correlated four histological
	plaque components with a specific spectrum analysis of the RF data.
	The different components (fibrous, fibrofatty, necrotic core and
	dense calcium) are colour coded. Coronary tissue maps were reconstructed
	from RF data using IVUS-Virtual Histology (VH IVUS) software (Real-Time
	VH, Volcano Corporation, Rancho Cordova, California, USA). VH IVUS
	has the potential to detect high-risk lesions and can provide new
	insights into the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease. VH
	IVUS allows the differentiation of different lesion types based on
	information derived from histopathology. The in vivo specific histological
	analysis of coronary atherosclerosis may allow better stratification
	of treatment of patients with coronary artery disease.},
