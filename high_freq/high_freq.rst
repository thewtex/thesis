High-frequency 3D Ultrasound Characterization
=============================================

High-frequency ultrasound imaging is useful for examining small objects -- it
has the advantage of high resolution at the expense of low penetration.  In this
chapter we explore new high frequency imaging techniques to interrogate the
excised plaques that result from endarterectomy.  First, we describe the methods
used to adapt a commercial high-frequency scanner system to perform low-level 3D
imaging research.  Next, we describe methods to characterize the acoustic
properties of high-frequency reference phantoms necessary to generate parametric
images.  Finally, we present initial 3D parametric images of the excised
plaques.

VisualSonics Vevo 770 system
============================

VisualSonics is a Toronto, Canada company that manufactures high-frequency
ultrasound imaging systems designed for pre-clinical research on small animal
targets.  Anatomical and real-time physiological imaging of mice and rats is
possible with resolutions up to 30 Î¼m and frame rates up 240 frames per second
(fps).  Primary features of the system are intended to allow longitudinal,
non-invasive monitoring of anatomical and hemodynamic features as well as for
theraputic intervention.  Some of these features include 2D B-Mode, 3D B-Mode
with a stepper motor system, M-Mode, pulse-wave Doppler, power Doppler, tissue
Doppler, and contrast agent imaging.  An ancillary feature of the system is the
output of radio-frequency (RF) raw data for basic analysis.  In this section we
describe methods to harness the RF output to perform advanced research.

Volume concatenation, storage, and processing
=============================================

The Vevo 770 system is the last generation
of Vevo line systems that are designed around rotated single-element
transducers; beginning with the Vevo 2100 and later, the transducers are high
frequency linear array systems.
