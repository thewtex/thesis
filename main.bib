  abstract = {In 1996, we showed that inflamed atherosclerotic plaques give off
	more heat and that vulnerable plaques may be detected by measuring
	their temperature. Plaque temperature is correlated directly with
	inflammatory cell density and inversely with the distance of the
	cell clusters from the luminal surface. It is inversely related to
	the density of the smooth muscle cells. We found no significant association
	between temperature heterogeneity and presence of Chlamydia pneumoniae
	in plaque or the gross color of human atherosclerotic carotid plaques.
	We also found pH heterogeneity in plaques from human carotid artery
	and aortas of Watanabe atherosclerotic rabbits and apolipoprotein
	E-deficient mice. Areas with lower pH had higher temperature, and
	areas with a large lipid core showed lower pH with higher temperature,
	whereas calcified regions had lower temperature and higher pH. We
	also developed a thermography basket catheter and showed in vivo
	temperature heterogeneity in atherosclerotic lesions of atherosclerotic
	dogs and Watanabe rabbits. Thermal heterogeneity was later documented
	in human atherosclerotic coronary arteries. Temperature difference
	between atherosclerotic plaque and healthy vessel wall is related
	to clinical instability. It is correlated with systemic markers of
	inflammation and is a strong predictor of adverse cardiac events
	after percutaneous interventions. Thermography is the first in a
	series of novel "functional" imaging methods and is moving to clinical
	trials. It may be useful for a variety of clinical and research purposes,
	such as detection of vulnerable plaques and risk stratification of
	vulnerable patients.},

  abstract = {In previous methods of data reduction used to determine ultrasonic
	backscatter coefficients, various approximations were made. One frequently
	used is that there is an abrupt cutoff in the lateral extent of the
	scattering volume interrogated. Another approximation in all previous
	methods is that the effect of time gating the received echo signals
	can be written as a function of the distance along the axis of the
	interrogating beam. In the present paper we show that the backscatter
	coefficient can be derived from experimental data without making
	such approximations. The cases of narrow-band and broadband pulses
	are treated, and the method is applicable whatever the distance between
	the interrogated volume of scatterers and the transducer face. It
	is shown that, for a given pulse form, the gate duration must be
	sufficiently long in order to attain a specified accuracy for the
	measured backscatter coefficient. A test of the method was done using
	a phantom with well-defined scattering properties. Very good agreement
	was found between measured values of backscatter coefficients and
	those calculated using a first-principles theory.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Thrombosis on atherosclerotic lesions in the
	large extracranial arteries is the main cause of embolization in
	the distal cerebral circulation and thus is involved in the pathogenesis
	of ischemic stroke. The assessment of biological characteristics
	of lesions that are predictive of thrombotic complications might
	help in stratification of the risk for stroke but is currently imperfect.
	METHODS: We compared the performance of (111)In-platelet scintigraphy
	with blood pool subtraction, ultrasound-based tissue texture analyses,
	and transcranial Doppler techniques in their ability to predict the
	occurrence of superficial thrombosis or the presence of a lipid pool
	in carotid artery plaque specimens removed at the time of carotid
	endarterectomy in 22 patients with unilateral carotid artery stenosis
	of >70\%. RESULTS: Positivity at (111)In-platelet scintigraphy was
	present in 8 patients and correctly identified the presence of thrombosis
	superimposed on a complicated plaque. Neither tissue texture analysis
	nor emboli detection by transcranial Doppler, performed in 12 patients,
	significantly identified plaque thrombosis. None of the techniques
	used were able to detect the presence of a significant lipid pool
	inside the plaque. CONCLUSIONS: Indium-platelet scintigraphy is an
	accurate noninvasive diagnostic tool to detect thrombotic complications
	in carotid plaques. Prospective studies should assess its ultimate
	value in risk stratification, possibly to guide the decision of whether
	to perform endarterectomy in selected patient categories.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence for efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy in
	stroke is limited. Symptomatic carotid stenosis patients are at high
	risk of early recurrent stroke. In this group, asymptomatic microembolic
	signals (MES), detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD),
	are markers of future stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA)
	risk. They offer a surrogate marker to evaluate antiplatelet therapy,
	but no multicenter study has evaluated the feasibility of this approach.
	METHODS AND RESULTS: Clopidogrel and Aspirin for Reduction of Emboli
	in Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis (CARESS) is a randomized, double-blind
	study in subjects with recently symptomatic > or =50\% carotid stenosis.
	Patients were screened with TCD, and if MES were detected, they were
	randomized to clopidogrel and aspirin or aspirin monotherapy. Repeated
	TCD recordings were made on days 2 and 7. MES were detected in 110
	of 230 patients by online analysis at baseline, of whom 107 were
	randomized. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed a significant reduction
	in the primary end point: 43.8\% of dual-therapy patients were MES
	positive on day 7, as compared with 72.7\% of monotherapy patients
	(relative risk reduction 39.8\%; 95\% CI, 13.8 to 58.0; P=0.0046).
	The secondary end point of MES frequency per hour was reduced (compared
	with baseline) by 61.4\% (95\% CI, 31.6 to 78.2; P=0.0013) in the
	dual-therapy group at day 7 and by 61.6\% (95\% CI, 34.9 to 77.4;
	P=0.0005) on day 2. There were 4 recurrent strokes and 7 TIAs in
	the monotherapy group versus no stroke and 4 TIAs in the dual-therapy
	group that were treatment emergent and ipsilateral to the qualifying
	carotid stenosis; 2 additional ipsilateral TIAs occurred before treatment
	started. MES frequency was greater in the 17 patients with recurrent
	ipsilateral events compared with the 90 without (mean+/-SD: 24.4+/-27.7
	versus 8.9+/-11.5 per hour; P=0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with
	recently symptomatic carotid stenosis, combination therapy with clopidogrel
	and aspirin is more effective than aspirin alone in reducing asymptomatic
	embolization. Doppler MES detection is a feasible method to evaluate
	the efficacy of antiplatelet therapy in multicenter studies.},

	intravascular elastography (IVE) is capable of extracting information
	on the plaque local mechanical properties and composition. This paper
	reports additional IVE validation data regarding reproducibility
	and potential to characterize atherosclerotic plaques and mural thrombi.
	In a first investigation, radio frequency (RF) data were acquired
	from the abdominal aorta of an atherosclerotic rabbit model. In a
	second investigation, IVUS RF data were recorded from the left coronary
	artery of a patient referred for angioplasty. In both cases, Galaxy
	IVUS scanners (Boston Scientific, Freemont, CA), equipped with 40
	MHz Atlantis catheters, were used. Elastograms were computed using
	two methods, the Lagrangian speckle model estimator (LSME) and the
	scaling factor estimator (SFE). Corroborated with histology, the
	LSME and the SFE both clearly detected a soft thrombus attached to
	the vascular wall. Moreover, shear elastograms, only available with
	the LSME, confirmed the presence of the thrombus. Additionally, IVE
	was found reproducible with consistent elastograms between cardiac
	cycles (CCs). Regarding the human dataset, only the LSME was capable
	of identifying a plaque that presumably sheltered a lipid core. Whereas
	such an assumption could not be certified with histology, radial
	shear and tangential strain LSME elastograms enabled the same conclusion.
	It is worth emphasizing that this paper reports the first ever in
	vivo tangential strain elastogram with regards to vascular imaging,
	due to the LSME. It is concluded that the IVE was reproducible exhibiting
	consistent strain patterns between CCs. The IVE might provide a unique

  abstract = {Changes in vessel wall elasticity may be indicative of vessel pathologies.
	It is known, for example, that the presence of plaque stiffens the
	vascular wall, and that the heterogeneity of its composition may
	lead to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Another domain of application
	where ultrasound elastography may be of interest is the study of
	vascular wall elasticity to predict the risk of aneurysmal tissue
	rupture. In this paper, this technology is introduced as an approach
	to noninvasively characterize superficial arteries. In such a case,
	a linear array ultrasound transducer is applied on the skin over
	the region of interest, and the arterial tissue is dilated by the
	normal cardiac pulsation. The elastograms, the equivalent elasticity
	images, are computed from the assessment of the vascular tissue motion.
	Investigating the forward problem, it is shown that motion parameters
	might be difficult to interpret; that is because tissue motion occurs
	radially within the vessel wall while the ultrasound beam propagates
	axially. As a consequence of that, the elastograms are subjected
	to hardening and softening artefacts, which are to be counteracted.
	In this paper, the Von Mises (VM) coefficient is proposed as a new
	parameter to circumvent such mechanical artefacts and to appropriately
	characterize the vessel wall. Regarding the motion assessment, the
	Lagrangian estimator was used; that is because it provides the full
	two-dimensional strain tensor necessary to compute the VM coefficient.
	The theoretical model was validated with biomechanical simulations
	of the vascular wall properties. The results allow believing in the
	potential of the method to differentiate hard plaques and lipid pools
	from normal vascular tissue. Potential in vivo implementation of
	noninvasive vascular elastography to characterize abdominal aneurysms
	and superficial arteries such as the femoral and the carotid is discussed.},

	fracture mechanics suggest that analysis of local variations in surface
	deformability may provide information on relative vulnerability to
	plaque fissuring or rupture. We investigated plaque surface deformations
	in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery disease
	using 4-dimensional ultrasonography and techniques for measuring
	optical flow. METHODS: Four-dimensional ultrasound examinations of
	carotid artery plaques were performed in 23 asymptomatic and 22 symptomatic
	patients with 50\% to 90\% stenosis of the internal carotid artery.
	Plaque surface motion during 1 cardiac cycle was computed with a
	hierarchical model-based motion estimator. Results were compared
	with plaque echogenicity and surface structure. RESULTS: Of the 45
	patients examined, plaque surface motion estimates were obtained
	for 18 asymptomatic and 13 symptomatic patients. There were no significant
	differences in echogenicity or surface structure of asymptomatic
	and symptomatic plaques (P>0.05). Results of motion estimation showed
	that asymptomatic plaques had surface motion vectors of equal orientation
	and magnitude to those of the internal carotid artery, whereas symptomatic
	plaques demonstrated evidence of inherent plaque movement. There
	was no significant difference in maximal plaque velocity between
	symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques (P<0.14). Maximal discrepant
	surface velocity (MDSV) in symptomatic plaques was 3.85+/-1.26 mm/s
	(mean+/-SD), which was significantly higher (P<0.001) than MDSV of
	asymptomatic plaques with 0.58+/-0.42 mm/s (mean+/-SD). CONCLUSIONS:
	++MDSV of carotid artery plaques is significantly different in asymptomatic
	and symptomatic disease. Further studies are warranted to determine
	whether plaque surface motion patterns can identify vulnerable plaques
	in patients with carotid artery stenosis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thromboembolic disease secondary to complicated carotid
	atherosclerotic plaque is a major cause of cerebral ischemia. Clinical
	management relies on the detection of significant (>70\%) carotid
	stenosis. A large proportion of patients suffer irreversible cerebral
	ischemia as a result of lesser degrees of stenosis. Diagnostic techniques
	that can identify nonstenotic high-risk plaque would therefore be
	beneficial. High-risk plaque is defined histologically if it contains
	hemorrhage/thrombus. Magnetic resonance direct thrombus imaging (MRDTI)
	is capable of detecting methemoglobin within intraplaque hemorrhage.
	We assessed this as a marker of complicated plaque and compared its
	accuracy with histological examination of surgical endarterectomy
	specimens. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-three patients underwent successful
	MRDTI and endarterectomy with histological examination. Of these,
	44 were histologically defined as complicated (type VI plaque). MRDTI
	demonstrated 3 false-positive and 7 false-negative results, giving
	a sensitivity and specificity of 84\%, negative predictive value
	of 70\%, and positive predictive value of 93\%. The interobserver
	(kappa=0.75) and intraobserver (kappa=0.9) agreement for reading
	MRDTI scans was good. CONCLUSIONS: MRDTI of the carotid vessels in
	patients with cerebral ischemia is an accurate means of identifying
	histologically confirmed complicated plaque. The high contrast generated
	by short T1 species within the plaque allows for ease of interpretation,
	making this technique highly applicable in the research and clinical

	people die per year without ever being admitted to a hospital. One
	of the main reasons of such a high death-rate without any diagnosis
	is that more than 50 or heart-attacks) occur in patients with no
	prior history of known heart disease or symptoms. Coronary artery
	disease leads to the occlusion of arteries that are vital in providing
	nutrients to the heart muscles. The disease develops by progressive
	accumulation or formation of "plaque" within an artery. Certain types
	of plaques could occlude blood flow and yet might be "stable". These
	plaques usually have a high fibrous content, and are known as hard
	plaques. On the other hand, "unstable" or "soft" plaques might not
	cause much occlusion but could be vulnerable to rupture. Rupture
	of such plaques could lead to total or partial occlusion in arteries
	resulting in sudden cardiac death or heart-attack. In fact, 68 coronary
	arteries are less than 50.Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a minimally
	invasive imaging modality that provides cross-section images of arteries
	in real-time, allowing visualization of atherosclerotic plaques in
	vivo. In standard IVUS gray-scale images, calcified regions of plaque
	and dense fibrous components generally reflect ultrasound energy
	well and thus appear bright and homogeneous on IVUS images. Conversely,
	regions of low echo reflectance in IVUS images are usually labeled
	"soft" or "mixed" plaque. However, this visual interpretation has
	been demonstrated to be very inconsistent in accurately determining
	plaque composition and does not allow real-time assessment of quantitative
	plaque constituents.Spectral analysis of the backscattered radiofrequency
	(RF) ultrasound signals allows detailed assessment of plaque composition.
	Advanced mathematical techniques can be employed to extract spectral
	information from these RF data to determine composition. The spectral
	content or signature of RF data reflected from tissue depends on
	density, compressibility, concentration, size, etc. A combination
	of spectral parameters were used to develop statistical classification
	schemes for analysis of in vivo IVUS data in real-time. The clinical
	data acquisition system is ECG gated and the analysis software developed
	by our group reconstructs IVUS gray-scale images from the acquired
	RF data. A combination of spectral parameters and active contour
	models is used for real-time 3D plaque segmentation followed by computation
	of color-coded tissue maps for each image cross-section and longitudinal
	views of the entire vessel. The "fly-through" mode allows one to
	visualize the complete length of the artery internally with the histology
	components at the lumen surface. In addition, vessel and plaque metrics
	such as areas and volumes of individual plaque components (collagen,
	fibro-lipid, calcium, lipid-core) are also available.},

	total anterior circulation infarcts (TACIs); partial anterior circulation

	undergoing standard carotid endarterectomy. Carotid lesions were
	prospectively characterized on the basis of angiographic and duplex
	findings before endarterectomy and clinical findings. Specimens were
	encased in a polytetrafluoroethylene wrap and mounted in a flow chamber
	that allowed access for endovascular procedures and observations.
	Balloon angioplasty and stenting were performed under fluoroscopic
	guidance with either a Palmaz stent or a Wallstent endoprosthesis.
	Ex vivo angiograms were obtained before and after intervention. Effluent
	from each specimen was filtered for released embolic particles, which
	were microscopically examined, counted, and correlated with various
	plaque characteristics by means of multivariate analysis. RESULTS:
	Balloon angioplasty and stenting produced embolic particles that
	consisted of atherosclerotic debris, organized thrombus, and calcified
	material. The number of embolic particles detected after balloon
	angioplasty and stenting was not related to preoperative symptoms,
	sex, plaque ulceration or calcification, or artery size. However,
	echolucent plaques generated a higher number of particles compared
	with echogenic plaques (p < 0.01). In addition, increased lesion
	stenosis also significantly correlated with the total number of particles
	produced by balloon angioplasty and stenting (r = 0.55). Multivariate
	analysis revealed that these two characteristics were independent
	risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Echolucent plaques and plaques with stenosis
	> or = 90\% produced a higher number of embolic particles and therefore
	may be less suitable for balloon angioplasty and stenting. This ex
	vivo model can be used to identify high-risk lesions for balloon
	angioplasty and stenting and can aid in the evaluation of new devices
	being considered for carotid balloon angioplasty and stenting.},

	morphology with the patient's presenting symptoms has drawn conflicting
	conclusions. The purpose of this series was to correlate carotid
	plaque characteristics with the presenting symptoms from a large
	cohort of patients who underwent operation for carotid artery disease.
	METHODS: From a series of 1252 consecutive patients who underwent
	carotid endarterectomy, presenting symptoms were divided into three
	groups: transiently symptomatic (transient ischemic attack [TIA]
	or amaurosis fugax), prior stroke, and asymptomatic. Plaque characteristics,
	including ulceration, intraplaque hemorrhage, and degree of stenosis,
	were recorded prospectively for 1008 procedures. All endarterectomy
	specimens were inspected during the procedure, and plaque characteristics
	were recorded immediately after operation. RESULTS: There was a higher
	incidence of plaque ulceration in the transiently symptomatic and
	prior stroke groups (391 of 508 [77\%] and 91 of 115 [79\%]) than
	in the asymptomatic cohort (231 of 385 [60\%]; p < 0.0001, chi2 test).
	There was no significant difference in the incidence of plaque hemorrhage
	between the transiently symptomatic and prior stroke patients compared
	with the asymptomatic patients. There was no statistical difference
	for ulcerated plaque or plaque hemorrhage between the transiently
	symptomatic and prior stroke group. Intraplaque hemorrhage occurred
	more frequently in patients with high-grade stenosis (90\% to 99\%)
	than in those with less than 90\% stenosis (202 of 299 [68\%] versus
	97 of 299 [32\%]; p = 0.01, chi2 test). CONCLUSIONS: On gross examination
	of the carotid specimen in the operating room, plaque ulceration
	correlates with an initial presentation of amaurosis fugax, TIA,
	or prior stroke compared with patients operated on for asymptomatic
	disease. The presence of intraplaque hemorrhage is associated with
	more advanced stenosis of the internal carotid artery. These findings
	suggest that plaque morphology does play an important role in the

	33.9\% of asymptomatic (p<0. 05) and in 7.7\% for plaques that were

	echolucent plaques are associated with a higher neurological risk.
	In homogenous plaques the absence of an echogenic cap and disruption

	at baseline, were 65 years of age or older and without symptoms of
	cerebrovascular disease was followed up for an average of 3.3 years.
	Baseline clinical findings were from color Doppler and duplex US
	studies of the carotid arteries and a record of traditional risk
	factors: age, sex, presence of diabetes mellitus, pack-years of cigarette
	smoking, presence of hypertension, elevated systolic and diastolic
	blood pressure, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level.
	RESULTS: Incident strokes, excluding hemorrhagic strokes and strokes

	Age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios for incident stroke were significant
	for hypoechoic plaque (odds ratio, 2.53; 95\% CI, 1,42,4.53). After
	controlling for risk factors in a Cox proportional hazards model,
	the relative risk (RR) of incident stroke was 1.72 (p = .015) for

	extracranial carotid plaque surface irregularity and ischemic stroke.
	Using a prospective cohort design, we evaluated the association of
	carotid plaque surface irregularity and the risk of ischemic stroke
	in a multiethnic population. METHODS: High-resolution B-mode ultrasound
	of the carotid arteries was performed in 1939 stroke-free subjects
	(mean age 69+/-10.0 years; 59\% women; 53\% Hispanic, 25\% black,
	22\% white). Plaque was defined as a focal protrusion 50\% greater
	than the surrounding area and localized along the extracranial carotid
	tree (internal carotid artery/bifurcation vs common carotid artery).
	Plaque surface was categorized as regular or irregular. Cox proportional
	hazard models were used to assess the association of surface characteristics
	and the risk of ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Among 1939 total subjects,
	carotid plaque was visualized in 56.3\% (1 plaque: 21.6\%, >1 plaque:
	34.7\%, irregular plaque: 5.5\%). During a mean follow up of 6.2
	years after ultrasound examination, 69 ischemic strokes occurred.
	Unadjusted cumulative 5-year risks of ischemic stroke were: 1.3\%,
	3.0\%, and 8.5\% for no plaque, regular plaque, and irregular plaque,
	respectively. After adjusting for demographics, traditional vascular
	risk factors, degree of stenosis, and plaque thickness, presence
	of irregular plaque (vs no plaque) was independently associated with
	ischemic stroke (Hazard ratio, 3.1; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 8.5). CONCLUSIONS:
	The presence of irregular carotid plaque independently predicted
	ischemic stroke in a multiethnic cohort. Plaque surface irregularities
	assessed by B-mode ultrasonography may help identify intermediate-
	to high-risk individuals beyond their vascular risk assessed by the
	presence of traditional risk factors.},

	the bedside monitoring of static and dynamic cerebral flow and treatment
	response. Introduced by Rune Aaslid in 1982, it has become indispensable
	in clinical practice. The main obstacle to ultrasound penetration
	of the skull is bone. Low frequencies, 1-2 MHz, reduce the attenuation
	of the ultrasound wave caused by bone. Transcranial Doppler also
	provides the advantage of acoustic windows representing specific
	points of the skull where the bone is thin enough to allow ultrasounds
	to penetrate. There are four acoustic windows: transtemporal, transorbital,
	suboccipital and retromandibular. The identification of each intracranial
	vessel is based on the following elements: (a) velocity and direction;
	(b) depth of signal capture; (c) possibility of following the vessel
	its whole length; (d) spatial relationship with other vessels; and
	(e) response to homolateral and contralateral carotid compression.
	The main fields of clinical application of transcranial Doppler are
	assessment of vasospasm, detection of stenosis of the intracranial
	arteries, evaluation of cerebrovascular autoregulation, non-invasive
	estimation of intracranial pressure, measure of effective downstream
	pressure and assessment of brain death. Mean flow velocity is directly
	proportional to flow and inversely proportional to the section of
	the vessel. Any circumstance that leads to a variation of one of
	these factors can thus affect mean velocity. The main pathological
	condition affecting flow velocity is the vasospasm. Vasospasm is
	a frequent complication of subarachnoid haemorrhage, it often remains
	clinically silent and the factors that make it symptomatic are largely
	unknown. Threshold velocities above which vasospasm comes into place
	are well defined as regards the median cerebral artery, while there
	is no consensus for the other vessels. Nevertheless, an increase
	in velocity alone is not sufficient to arrive at a diagnosis of vasospasm;
	a condition of hyperaemia also presents with an increase in flow
	velocity. The Lindegaard Index has therefore been introduced, which
	is defined by the ratio between the mean flow velocity in the median
	cerebral artery and the mean flow velocity in the internal carotid
	artery. Criteria for diagnosis of a stenosis >50\% of an intracranial
	vessel with transcranial Doppler include: (a) segmentary acceleration
	of flow velocity; (b) drop in velocity below the stenotic segment;
	(c) asymmetry; and (d) circumscribed flow disturbances (turbulence
	and musical murmur). The transcranial Doppler enables us to assess
	both components of self-regulation. The static component is measured
	by observing changes in flow velocity caused by pharmacologically
	induced episodes of hypertension and hypotension. The dynamic component
	of autoregulation can be measured using a method devised by Aaslid
	known as the 'cuff test'. A very effective and safe device for measuring
	cerebral autoregulation is the transient hyperaemic response test.
	This test is based on the compensatory vasodilatation of the arterioles,
	which occurs after brief compression of the common carotid. Csonyka
	proposed the following formula based on clinical observation for
	the calculation of cerebral perfusion pressure: CPP = MAP x FVd/FVm
	+ 14. Brain death is defined as the irreversible cessation of all
	functions of the whole brain. The clinical criteria are usually considered
	sufficient to establish a diagnosis of brain death; however, they
	might not be sufficient in patients who have been on sedatives or
	when there are ethical or legal controversies. Many authors have
	demonstrated the existence of a transcranial Doppler pattern, which
	is typical of brain death.},

	World. Atherosclerosis of the carotid artery is the most important
	predictor of stroke. Elastography is a technique to assess the composition
	and vulnerability of an atherosclerotic plaque. Contrary to intravascular
	applications, the ultrasound beam and radial strain are not aligned
	in noninvasive acquisitions. In this study, 2D displacement and strain
	images were determined and used to calculate the radial and circumferential
	strain. Rf-data were acquired using a Philips SONOS 7500 live 3D
	ultrasound system, equipped with an 11_3L (3 to 11 MHz) linear array
	transducer and rf-interface. A homogeneous, hollow cylinder phantom
	[20\% gelatin, 1\% SiC scatterers (10 microM)] was measured in a
	water tank at different intraluminal pressures. In addition, measurements
	in patients (n = 12) were made to evaluate the in vivo applicability
	of the technique. Longitudinal and cross-sectional recordings were
	made, both in phantoms and patients. Strain along the ultrasound
	beam (axial strain) was determined using cross-correlation analysis
	for signal-windows from both the pre- and post-compression data.
	For lateral strain, new ultrasound lines were generated between the
	acquired lines using interpolation. A cross-correlation based search
	algorithm was applied to determine lateral displacement and strain.
	Longitudinal axial strain images in the phantom showed a decreasing
	strain from the lumen- vessel wall interface to the outer region
	that can be described by a 1 over r(2) relationship. The lateral
	strain image showed no strain in this direction indicating a plane
	strain situation. In the cross-sectional view, compression of the
	material in regions at 12 and 6 o'clock was observed, whereas expansion
	was observed in regions at 3 and 9 o'clock. This pattern is in accordance
	with theory, but can only be partly corrected for: in the transition
	regions, zero axial strain was measured. The lateral strain image
	showed a complementary pattern. In patients, low strain was observed
	in nonatherosclerotic artery walls. High and low strain regions were
	found in atherosclerotic plaques. High quality elastograms were generated
	both in longitudinal and cross-sectional views. In conclusion, 2D
	noninvasive elastography of atherosclerotic carotid plaques is feasible.
	Phantom studies revealed elastograms in accordance with theory. Additional
	in vivo validation is needed to assess the value of this technique
	for identifying plaque vulnerability and composition.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major thrombotic and embolic complications of atherosclerosis
	are closely associated with irregularity and rupture of atheromatous
	plaques in both the carotid and coronary arteries. Plaque instability
	is partly determined by local factors, but systemic factors, such
	as infection, autoimmunity, or genes, may also be important. If plaque
	stability is influenced by systemic factors that are present in only
	a proportion of patients, some individuals should be more prone to
	rupture of plaques than others--ie, irregular plaques should occur
	in multiple vascular beds in some individuals more frequently than
	would be expected by chance alone. METHODS: We studied 5393 carotid
	bifurcation angiograms from 3007 patients with a recently symptomatic
	carotid stenosis. We assessed the extent to which plaque-surface
	irregularity at the symptomatic carotid artery was associated with
	irregularity at a distant site, the contralateral carotid artery,
	and the extent to which plaque irregularity at these sites was associated
	with previous myocardial infarction or subsequent non-stroke vascular
	death (due mainly to coronary-artery disease). FINDINGS: Patients
	with plaque-surface irregularity (n=1897) in the symptomatic carotid
	artery were more likely than those with smooth plaque (n=110) to
	have irregularity in the contralateral carotid artery (odds ratio
	2.21 [95\% CI 1.62-3.01], p<0.001). Patients with irregular plaques
	in both arteries were more likely to have had a previous myocardial
	infarction than patients with smooth plaques (hazard ratio 1.82 [1.23-2.64],
	p<0.001), and were more likely to have a non-stroke vascular death
	on follow-up (hazard ratio 1.67 [1.15-2.44], p=0.007). However, there
	was no difference in the risk of non-vascular death (hazard ratio
	0.92 [0.57-1.45], p=0.5). These associations were not explicable
	on the basis of differences in traditional vascular risk factors.
	INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that some individuals have a systemic
	predisposition to irregularity and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques
	that is independent of traditional vascular risk factors. This finding
	supports the hypothesis that other systemic factors are important
	in the cause of plaque instability.},

	ipsilateral ischaemic stroke, and is the treatment of choice, in
	patients with recently symptomatic 70-99\% carotid stenosis. However,
	the 3-year risk of stroke on medical treatment alone is only about
	20\%. We investigated whether the efficacy of endarterectomy would
	be improved if patients with a high risk of stroke on medical treatment
	and a low risk of operative stroke or death could be identified.
	METHODS: We developed two prognostic models from data on patients
	with 0-69\% carotid stenosis in the European Carotid Surgery Trial
	(ECST). The medical model predicted risk of ipsilateral carotid territory
	major ischaemic stroke (fatal or lasting longer than 7 days) on medical
	treatment and the surgical model predicted risk of major stroke and
	death within 30 days of endarterectomy. From these models we developed
	a prognostic score to identify patients with a high risk of stroke
	on medical treatment but a low operative risk. We validated the models
	and tested the scoring system on 990 ECST patients with 70-99\% carotid
	stenosis assigned surgery (594) or medical treatment only (396).
	FINDINGS: When patients with 70-99\% stenosis were stratified by
	the scoring system, which was based on seven independent prognostic
	factors, endarterectomy was beneficial in only 162 (16\%) patients.
	The 5-year absolute risk of carotid territory ipsilateral major ischaemic
	stroke, operative major stroke, or death was lowered by 33\% in the
	16\% of patients with a score of 4 or more (odds ratio 0.12 [95\%
	CI 0.05-0.29], p<0.0001), but not in the other 828 (84\%) patients
	(1.00 [0.65-1.54], p=0.7). INTERPRETATION: Many patients with recently
	symptomatic 70-99\% carotid stenosis may not benefit from carotid

	datasets, but risk-factor modelling could be useful to identify those

	Eight patients with symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis were imaged

	The estimated net 18FDG accumulation rate (plaque/integral plasma)

	This study demonstrates that atherosclerotic plaque inflammation

	will cause cardiovascular events. Noninvasive magnetic resonance
	(MR) imaging has great potential to enable characterization of atherosclerotic

	plaques by using existing MR techniques. The use of MR imaging in
	animal models and in human disease in various vascular beds, particularly
	the carotid arteries, is presented.},

  abstract = {Stroke is the third most common cause of mortality in the United States
	with an incidence rate of approximately 700 000 deaths per year.
	As a means to prevent cerebrovascular events, current concepts advocate
	endarterectomy or carotid stenting in patients with advanced carotid
	disease. Arterial stenosis alone has been shown to be a poor predictor
	of cardiovascular events and therefore both arterial stenosis and
	patient symptom status are taken as indications for interventional
	therapy. Several studies have shown that symptomatic subjects benefit
	more from a carotid endarterectomy than asymptomatic subjects: 3-6
	carotid endarterectomies are needed to prevent one stroke per year
	in symptomatic subjects with > 70 \% stenosis compared to 14 - 17
	carotid endarterectomies in asymptomatic patients with > 50 \% stenosis.
	It is commonly accepted today that factors other than the degree
	of luminal stenosis can determine a patient's symptom status, such
	as the composition or the superficial structure of atherosclerotic
	plaque. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging has overcome the
	limitations of current angiographic techniques and has emerged as
	a leading non-invasive imaging modality for atherosclerotic disease,
	especially within carotid arteries and other large vessels. In this
	review, the state of the art in MRI of atherosclerosis is presented
	in terms of hardware and image acquisition protocols. Also, the results
	of validation studies for measuring lesion size, composition and
	inflammation will be summarized. Finally, the status of several clinical
	trials involving MRI of atherosclerosis will be reviewed.},

	plaque. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role and the
	diagnostic efficacy of multidetector row CT angiography (MDCTA) and
	ultrasound (US) echo color Doppler (US-ECD) in the study of patients
	with carotid plaque complicated by ulceration through the comparison
	with the surgical observation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January
	2004 to October 2005, 237 patients, for a total of 474 carotid arteries,
	studied at first with color Doppler US, were analyzed using CT angiography.
	A total of 103 patients underwent a carotid endarterectomy. We analyzed
	stenosis degree, plaque composition, and presence of ulcerations.
	In a second phase, the data were compared with the surgical results
	when the MDCTA indicated surgical intervention. RESULTS: MDCTA found
	31 ulcerations; the surgical confirmation underlined a 93.75\% sensitivity
	and a 98.59\% specificity. US-ECD performances were 37.5\% and 91.5\%
	for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The number of patients
	who showed plaque ulcerations increased with the severity of stenosis.
	Furthermore, ulcerations of the carotid plaque occurred more often
	proximal than distal to the point of maximum stenosis, and this trend
	increased with the severity of the stenosis. We also determined that
	fatty plaques were more likely to be affected by ulcerations. CONCLUSIONS:
	The results of our study suggest that MDCTA detects with higher sensitivity
	and specificity the presence of ulcerated plaque compared with US-ECD,
	which has been demonstrated to be less effective in this evaluation.
	Considering the high MDCTA sensitivity and specificity for detection
	of plaque ulceration, we therefore recommend MDCTA as a useful step
	for correct presurgical planning.},

	of this work was to evaluate the agreement between ultrasound echo-color
	Doppler (US-ECD) and multidetector-row CT angiography (MDCTA) in
	determining the degree of carotid stenosis. Methods and Materials:
	From January 2004 to February 2007, 187 patients who had previously
	undergone both US-ECD and MDCTA were studied retrospectively. For
	each patient, stenosis degree was measured by applying the North
	American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria. Data
	derived from MDCTA and US-ECD were then compared to calculate the
	inter-technique variability by using Cohen kappa statistics. For
	all plaque types (fatty, mixed and calcified), inter-technique variability
	was assessed. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to highlight
	differences between the procedures, and scatterplots were also calculated.
	As a gold standard, reference surgical comparisons were performed
	in 50 patients. Results: The percentage of observed agreements in
	the evaluation of stenosis degree was 72.19\% with a kappa value
	of 0.659 (95\% confidence interval: 0.604-0.715) and a weighted kappa
	of 0.789. After the evaluating stenosis degree in fatty, mixed and
	calcified plaques, the percentages of observed agreements were 79.31,
	74.58 and 64.29\%, respectively, with kappa values of 0.738, 0.691
	and 0.565. Conclusion: A good agreement between US-ECD and MDCTA
	in the evaluation of stenosis degree was observed, together with
	a remarkable difference between the 2 techniques in the assessment
	both of calcified plaques and of plaques showing a predominant calcific

	and we selected 160 coronary lesions without significant stenosis
	for evaluation. Ultrasound signals were obtained by an IVUS system
	using a 40-MHz catheter. RESULTS: At the follow-up (30 +/- 7 months),
	12 plaques caused ACS after the initial IVUS examination. Ten of
	the 12 plaques had IVUS parameters recorded at baseline. These 10
	plaques were classified as vulnerable plaques (VP), and the other
	plaques were classified as stable plaques (SP; n = 143). There was
	no significant difference of vessel area, lumen area, and plaque
	area between VP and SP. However, plaque burden (60 +/- 9\% vs. 52
	+/- 9\%; p = 0.014), eccentricity (0.70 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.55 +/- 0.17;

	the main cause of acute coronary events. At present it is not known

	depends more on plaque composition and vulnerability (plaque type)
	than on the degree of stenosis (plaque size). Lipid accumulation
	and chronic inflammation, particularly macrophage activities, seem
	to influence the development and the stability of a plaque and thus
	its propensity to rupture. Macrophages have the ability to secrete
	proteolytic enzymes and often infiltrate the region of imminent plaque
	rupture, and disruption may be associated with a generalized inflammatory
	reaction. Further, plaque disruption tends to occur at points where
	the plaque surface is weakest, corresponding to locations where mechanical
	and hemodynamic forces have their highest impact. The risk of plaque
	disruption is a function of both plaque vulnerability (intrinsic
	disease) and rupture triggers (extrinsic forces). The former predisposes
	the plaque to rupture; the latter may precipitate rupture. The danger
	of vulnerable plaques, however, is not related to disruption as such
	but to the resulting thrombosis. The magnitude of this thrombotic
	response and the ensuing flow obstruction depends on the contents
	and quantity of exposed thrombogenic plaque material, the degree

	fields are discontinuous. In this paper, we present a new 2D multi-level
	motion or displacement tracking method for accurate estimation of
	the strain in these situations. The final high-resolution displacement
	estimate is obtained using two processing steps. The first step involves
	an estimation of a coarse displacement estimate utilizing B-mode
	or envelope signals. To reduce computational time, the coarse displacement
	estimates are obtained starting from down-sampled B-mode pre- and
	post-compression image pairs using a pyramidal processing approach.
	The coarse displacement estimate obtained from the B-mode data is
	used to guide the final 2D cross-correlation computations on radio-frequency
	(RF) data. Results from finite element simulations and in vivo experimental
	data demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for imaging tissue
	with discontinuous displacement fields.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arterial thrombosis plays a critical role in acute coronary
	syndromes and stroke. Therefore, the ability to detect thrombus in
	vivo has a significant clinical implication. Magnetic resonance imaging
	(MRI) has shown promise in noninvasive thrombus detection. However,
	thrombus characterization and age definition remain difficult. We
	sought to evaluate the use of a fibrin-targeted peptide (EP-2104R)
	for MR thrombus detection and to compare this modality with non-contrast-enhanced
	(NCE) MRI and with Gd-DTPA injection at various ages and time points
	after thrombus generation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Carotid artery thrombosis
	was induced by external injury and stasis in 18 rabbits. T1-weighted
	MRI was performed before and after contrast agent injection, within
	6 hours of thrombus induction, at 48 hours, at 1 week, and every
	week up to 8 weeks after injury. Correlation with histopathology
	was performed. The fibrin-targeted contrast agent accurately detected
	all thrombi, regardless of their size, location, and age. Although
	thrombus signal intensity after injection decreased with thrombus
	age (P<0.001), enhancement at 8 weeks was still present. Gd-DTPA
	injection was not associated with an improvement of thrombus detection.
	EP-2104R was superior to both NCE and Gd-DTPA injection (P<0.001).
	Histopathologic examination showed thrombus organization over time.
	Fibrin was gradually replaced by fibrous tissue. A strong correlation
	was found between thrombus enhancement and collagen content of the
	organizing thrombus with time (R=-0.89; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In
	an experimental animal model of carotid thrombosis, we have demonstrated
	the superiority of a fibrin-targeted MR contrast agent for in vivo
	detection of chronic or organized thrombus, compared with NCE MRI

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The value of carotid endarterectomy (CEA)
	depends on the safety of the operation. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound
	(TCD) was used to evaluate the possibilities of hypoperfusion, hyperperfusion,
	and embolization as causes of stroke and to evaluate the significance
	of Doppler microembolic signals (DMES). METHODS: Five hundred CEAs
	were monitored with TCD of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery
	during various phases of CEA to determine hemodynamic changes and
	incidence of DMES. Complications were graded according to their severity,
	and their probable cause was determined from TCD criteria and review
	of hospital charts. RESULTS: We observed 24 cerebrovascular complications
	(4.8\%), including 9 with transient ischemic attacks and 15 (3\%)
	with permanent deficits. Among all cerebrovascular complications,
	embolism was judged to be responsible in 13 (54\%; P < .02 compared
	with hypoperfusion), hyperperfusion in 7 (29\%; P < .14 compared
	with hypoperfusion), and hypoperfusion in 4 (17\%; P < .08 compared
	with embolism plus hyperperfusion). The surgeons responded to TCD
	information by several strategies depending on the TCD information.
	The incidence of permanent deficits diminished from 7\% in the first
	100 operations to 2\% in the last 400 (P < or = .01). Shunting was
	more strongly associated with cerebrovascular complications than
	nonshunting, but this difference was not significant (P = .24). Intraoperative
	prevalence of DMES was strongly associated with cerebrovascular complications
	(P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Embolism is the principal cause of cerebrovascular
	complications from CEA; hyperperfusion and hypoperfusion are also
	important causes. TCD provides information that allows prompt identification
	and treatment of these three major causes of stroke from this operation.
	The perioperative stroke rate can be reduced by appropriate measures,
	taken by the surgeons, based on findings of TCD monitoring.},

	Temporal sequences of digitized B-mode ultrasound images of the carotid

	The motion of areas of the arterial wall was estimated using optical
	flow. Waveforms showing radial and axial displacements, as well as
	radial and axial velocities were produced for the selected ROIs using
	both techniques. Both techniques produced waveforms with peaks, corresponding
	to cardiac cycle events, that occurred at similar time points. To
	study the similarity of the waveforms obtained from the two techniques,
	a cross-correlation coefficient was calculated. Cross-correlation
	coefficients were 0.72..0.22 and 0.70..0.19 for displacements and

	could predict plaque histology better than an overall GSM measurement.
	METHODS: Thirty-one carotid plaques derived from 28 patients undergoing
	carotid endarterectomy were investigated by ultrasound. GSMs of the
	whole plaque were used as measurement of echogenicity. A profile
	of the regional GSM as a function of distance from the plaque surface
	could be generated. Plaque pixels were further mapped into 3 different
	colors depending on their GSM value. RESULTS: Plaques with large
	calcifications presented the highest GSM values, and those with large
	hemorrhagic areas or with a predominant necrotic core exhibited the
	lowest. Fibrous plaques had intermediate GSM values. A necrotic core
	located in a juxtalumenal position was associated with significantly
	lower GSM values (P=0.009) and with a predominant red color (GSM
	<50) at the surface (P=0.0019). With respect to the thickness of
	the fibrous cap and the position of the necrotic core, the sensitivity

	The stratified GSM measurement combined with color mapping showed
	a good correlation with the different histopathological components
	and further allowed identification with good accuracy of determinants
	of plaque instability. This approach should be investigated in a

  abstract = {It is well accepted that atherosclerosis initiation and progression
	correlate positively with low and oscillating flow wall shear stresses
	(FSS). However, this mechanism cannot explain why advanced plaques
	continue to grow under elevated FSS conditions. In vivo magnetic
	resonance imaging (MRI)-based 2D/3D multi-component models with fluid-structure
	interactions (FSI, 3D only) for human carotid atherosclerotic plaques
	were introduced to quantify correlations between plaque progression
	measured by wall thickness increase (WTI) and plaque wall (structure)
	stress (PWS) conditions. A histologically validated multi-contrast
	MRI protocol was used to acquire multi-year in vivo MRI images. Our
	results using 2D models (200-700 data points/patient) indicated that
	18 out of 21 patients studied showed significant negative correlation
	between WTI and PWS at time 2 (T2). The 95\% confidence interval
	for the Pearson correlation coefficient is (-0.443,-0.246), p<0.0001.
	Our 3D FSI model supported the 2D correlation results and further
	indicated that combining both plaque structure stress and flow shear
	stress gave better approximation results (PWS, T2: R(2)=0.279; FSS,
	T1: R(2)=0.276; combining both: R(2)=0.637). These pilot studies
	suggest that both lower PWS and lower FSS may contribute to continued
	plaque progression and should be taken into consideration in future
	investigations of diseases related to atherosclerosis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Given the importance of inflammation in atherosclerosis,
	we sought to determine if atherosclerotic plaque inflammation could
	be measured noninvasively in humans using positron emission tomography
	(PET). BACKGROUND: Earlier PET studies using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
	demonstrated increased FDG uptake in atherosclerotic plaques. Here
	we tested the ability of FDG-PET to measure carotid plaque inflammation
	in patients who subsequently underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
	METHODS: Seventeen patients with severe carotid stenoses underwent
	FDG-PET imaging 3 h after FDG administration (13 to 25 mCi), after
	which carotid plaque FDG uptake was determined as the ratio of plaque
	to blood activity (target to background ratio, TBR). Less than 1
	month after imaging, subjects underwent CEA, after which carotid
	specimens were processed to identify macrophages (staining with anti-CD68
	antibodies). RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between
	the PET signal from the carotid plaques and the macrophage staining
	from the corresponding histologic sections (r = 0.70; p < 0.0001).
	When mean FDG uptake (mean TBR) was compared with mean inflammation
	(mean percentage CD68 staining) for each of the 17 patients, the
	correlation was even stronger (r = 0.85; p < 0.0001). Fluorodeoxyglucose
	uptake did not correlate with plaque area, plaque thickness, or area
	of smooth muscle cell staining. CONCLUSIONS: We established that
	FDG-PET imaging can be used to assess the severity of inflammation
	in carotid plaques in patients. If subsequent natural history studies
	link increased FDG-PET activity in carotid arteries with clinical
	events, this noninvasive measure could be used to identify a subset
	of patients with carotid atherosclerosis in need of intensified medical
	therapy or carotid artery intervention to prevent stroke.},

	was to investigate the different mechanical responses exhibited by
	plaques with different compositions, focusing specifically on radial
	compressive behavior. A custom-built experimental system was developed
	that was fully computer controlled with a broad range of loading
	capabilities. A temperature-controlled, physiologic specimen bath
	allowed testing at 37 degrees C. Monotonically loaded specimens showed
	that plaque behavior was nonlinear under finite deformations. A multiple
	cycle protocol, executed in two phases, distinguished three types
	of mechanical response of different plaques. The differences in behavior
	were associated with histologic differences in plaque composition,
	and mechanically characterized by different ''repeatability'' (the
	stabilization of the cyclic response) and ''recoverability'' (the
	second loading phase retracing the first loading phase behavior).
	Type 1 behavior was categorized by repeatability and recoverability
	. Type 2 behavior displayed repeatability but only partial recovery
	during the second loading phase. Recovery was absent in type 3 behavior.
	The histologic observations demonstrated that calcified tissue was
	present only in specimens displaying type 1 behavior. Fibrous tissue
	and part of a modified media (due to disease) were present in specimens
	displaying type 2 behavior. An atheroma, along with a relatively
	thin modified media, was present in specimens displaying type 3 behavior.
	The differences in the maximum stretches attained at the end of phase
	I loading, the stretch offset from the first to the 15th cycle of
	phase I loading, and the hysteresis in the first and 15th cycles
	of phase I loading distinguished the specimen behaviors with statistical
	significance. These compression data showed that plaques exhibit

	five asymptomatic) individuals underwent plaque characterization
	magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Plaque geometry and composition
	were determined by multisequence review. Intrinsic plaque stress
	profiles were generated from 3D meshes by using finite element computational
	analysis. Differences in principal (shear) stress between normal
	and diseased sections of the carotid artery and between symptomatic
	and asymptomatic plaques were noted. RESULTS: There was a significant
	difference in peak principal stress between diseased and nondiseased
	segments of the artery (mean difference 537.65 kPa, p < 0.05). Symptomatic
	plaques had higher mean stresses than asymptomatic plaques (627.6
	kPa compared with 370.2 kPa, p = 0.05), which were independent of
	luminal stenosis and plaque composition. CONCLUSION: Significant
	differences in plaque stress exist between plaques from symptomatic

	were imaged with 1.5-T and 3.0-T MR imaging units with bilateral

	T2-weighted, intermediate-weighted, time-of-flight, and contrast
	material-enhanced T1-weighted images. Lumen area, wall area, total

	dichotomous variables. RESULTS: There was a strong level of agreement
	between field strengths for all morphologic variables, with ICCs
	ranging from 0.88 to 0.96. Agreement in the identification of presence
	or absence of plaque components was very good for calcification (kappa

	measured significantly (P = .03) larger at 3.0 T, while lipid-rich

	(P = .9). CONCLUSION: At higher field strengths, the increased susceptibility
	of calcification and paramagnetic ferric iron in hemorrhage may alter
	quantification and/or detection. Nevertheless, imaging criteria at

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The ultrasonic image can offer unique information
	on the composition of atherosclerotic plaque, ie, the relative content
	of lipids, fibrous tissue, and calcific deposits. To date, however,
	the echographic assessment of plaque structure is based on a subjective,
	qualitative evaluation of the bidimensional images. We evaluated
	the feasibility and accuracy of assessing, in vivo, the acoustic
	properties of arterial carotid plaques by means of a suitably modified
	echographic apparatus allowing direct access to the radiofrequency
	signal. METHODS: In 15 patients undergoing carotid thromboendarterectomy,
	the ultrasonic findings in 70 discrete sites (within the plaque,
	n = 54; normal sites, n = 11; or intraluminal thrombi, n = 5) were
	correlated with the histological analysis (hematoxylin-eosin and
	Mallory trichrome stains) independently performed on the arterial
	samples. The pathological examination was carried out at a similar
	level of the insonation; the sites analyzed within the plaque were
	chosen because of their uniform echoic characteristics. In each ultrasonic
	region of interest selected from the echographic image, the integrated
	amplitude of the rectified radiofrequency signal was measured as
	the integrated backscatter index. RESULTS: The intimal-medial layer
	of normal carotid wall (n = 11) exhibited values of -32.5 +/- 9.4
	dB. The integrated backscatter index in fatty sites (n = 11, -40.3
	+/- 5.4 dB) differed from that of fibrous (n = 12, -23.8 +/- 5.0
	dB) and calcified (n = 26, -11.5 +/- 5.2 dB, P < .01 for all intergroup
	differences) sites. Intraluminal thrombotic sites (n = 5, -42 +/-
	5.1 dB, P < .01) differed from fibrous and calcified subsets (P <
	.01) but overlapped (P = NS) with fatty sites. Histological sampling
	also showed two sites of intraplaque hemorrhage that exhibited very
	low backscatter values (-53 and -58 dB) and three fibrofatty sites
	showing backscatter values (-28, -28, and -32 dB) intermediate between
	the fibrous and the fatty subsets. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative analysis
	of integrated backscatter of the arterial wall is feasible in humans
	and provides an operator-independent assessment of plaque echoic
	structure. In particular, integrated backscatter is effective in
	distinguishing lipidic, fibrotic, and calcific components in human
	atherosclerotic plaques.},

  journal = {J Vasc Surg},
  year = {2008},
  month = {Sep},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that plaque vulnerability,
	rather than the degree of stenosis, is important in predicting the
	occurrence of subsequent cerebral ischemic events in patients with
	carotid artery stenosis. The many imaging modalities currently available
	have different properties with regard to the visualization of the
	extent of vulnerability in carotid plaque formation. METHODS: Original
	published studies were identified using the MEDLINE database (January
	1966 to March 2008). Manual cross-referencing was also performed.
	RESULTS: There is no single imaging modality that can produce definitive
	information about the state of vulnerability of an atherosclerotic
	plaque. Each has its own specific drawbacks, which may be the use
	of ionizing radiation or nephrotoxic contrast agents, an invasive
	character, low patient tolerability, or simply the paucity of information
	obtained on plaque vulnerability. Functional molecular imaging techniques
	such as positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission-computed
	tomography (SPECT) and near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) do seem
	able accurately to visualize and even quantify features of plaque
	vulnerability and its pathophysiologic processes. Promising new techniques
	like near infra-red fluorescence imaging are being developed and
	may be beneficial in this field. CONCLUSION: There is a promising
	role for functional molecular imaging modalities like PET, SPECT,
	or NIRS related to improvement of selection criteria for carotid
	intervention, especially when combined with CT or MRI to add further
	anatomical details to molecular information. Further information
	will be needed to define whether and where this functional molecular
	imaging will fit into a clinical strategy.},

	related to the stability of the plaque. Specifically, the plaque
	is likely to be unstable if the fibrous cap is thin. However, ultrasonic
	characterization of the atherosclerotic lesion has not been done
	from this viewpoint. Thus, in the present study ultrasonic tissue
	characterization of the carotid atherosclerotic lesion was attempted
	to assess the stability of the plaque. Integrated ultrasonic backscatter
	(IBS) in the atherosclerotic lesion was compared with histological
	findings of the respective tissue in 35 patients with carotid artery
	stenosis who underwent carotid endarterectomy. Carotid IBS was determined
	by locating the region-of-interest (ROI) in the center of the atherosclerotic
	lesion and calibrating by subtracting the IBS in the tunica externa
	of the vessel from the IBS of the ROI. IBS was also determined at
	the interface of the plaque, and at this site it was analyzed in
	relation to the thickness of the fibrous cap. Lipid content, fibrous
	tissue, thrombus, hemorrhage and calcification were histologically
	assessed in the respective tissue. Carotid IBS in the lipid lesion
	(-22.5+/-4.1 dB) was significantly different from that of fibrous,
	hemorrhagic or calcified lesions (-11.1+/-7.1, -27.5+/-4.1, +2.1+/-6.5
	dB, respectively), but there was no significant difference in IBS
	between the lipid lesion and thrombus (-15.2+/-8.8 dB). IBS was lower
	in the thin fibrous cap than in the thick lesion (-10.9+/-6.4 vs
	-2.4+/-6.2 dB, p<0.001). IBS can be used to characterize atherosclerotic
	lesions in the carotid artery; a low value at the interface suggests
	a thin fibrous cap, which is frequently associated with unstable
	plaque.},

	efficacy of CT angiography for the characterization of plaque morphology
	and composition in carotid atherosclerotic disease. METHODS: Fifty-five
	patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were imaged preoperatively
	with single-slice spiral CT angiography. One hundred sixty-five endarterectomy
	sections were examined histologically at selected levels through
	the distal common and proximal internal carotid arteries. Plaque
	density was measured (in Hounsfield units) on axial CT sections,
	and the presence or absence of ulceration was noted. These observations
	were compared with the histological findings at corresponding levels.
	Data were analyzed with 2-sample t tests and 1-way analysis of variance
	(ANOVA). RESULTS: ANOVA testing showed a statistically significant
	decrease in CT attenuation values with increasing plaque lipid but
	with a very high standard deviation of values. No other histological
	factor showed a statistically significant link with CT attenuation.
	Plaque ulceration was detected by CT with a sensitivity of 60\% and
	a specificity of 74\%. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of plaque attenuation
	with single-slice spiral CT does not give useful information concerning
	plaque composition. The predictive value of CT for the detection
	of plaque ulceration was moderate. Single-slice CT angiography is
	insufficiently robust to be a useful tool for the characterization
	of carotid plaque composition and morphology.},

	secondary stroke prevention. Non-invasive imaging, now widely available,
	is replacing intra-arterial angiography for carotid stenosis, but
	the accuracy remains uncertain despite an extensive literature. We
	systematically reviewed the accuracy of non-invasive imaging compared
	with intra-arterial angiography for diagnosing carotid stenosis in
	patients with carotid territory ischaemic symptoms.Methods We searched
	for articles published between 1980 and April 2004; included studies
	comparing non-invasive imaging with intra-arterial angiography that
	met Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) criteria;
	extracted data to calculate sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive
	imaging, to test for heterogeneity and to perform sensitivity analyses;
	and categorised percent stenosis by the North American Symptomatic
	Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) method.Results In 41 included
	studies (2541 patients, 4876 arteries), contrast-enhanced MR angiography
	was more sensitive (0·94, 95\% CI 0·88-0·97) and specific (0·93,
	95\% CI 0·89-0·96) for 70-99\% stenosis than Doppler ultrasound,
	MR angiography, and CT angiography (sensitivities 0·89, 0·88, 0·76;
	specificities 0·84, 0·84, 0·94, respectively). Data for 50-69\% stenoses
	and combinations of non-invasive tests were sparse and unreliable.
	There was heterogeneity between studies and evidence of publication
	bias.Interpretation Non-invasive tests, used cautiously, could replace
	intra-arterial carotid angiography for 70-99\% stenosis. However,
	more data are required to determine their accuracy, especially at
	50-69\% stenoses where the balance of risk and benefit for carotid
	endarterectomy is particularly narrow, and to explore and overcome
	heterogeneity. Methodology for evaluating imaging tests should be

  abstract = {Plaque formation begins with the transportation of lipoproteins into
	the arterial wall. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) carries most of
	the cholesterol in human plasma and becomes trapped within the subendothelial
	space of the wall. First, the lipid component of LDL is oxidized,
	and this process attracts monocytes to enter the wall and become
	macrophages, which further the oxidative process [1]. High-density
	lipoprotein (HDL) has been shown to inhibit this oxidative process
	[2], thereby providing protection against atherogenesis. Macrophages
	also modify the surface protein of LDL, apoprotein B, making it unrecognizable
	by the LDL receptor and leading to dysregulation with resultant massive
	accumulation of cholesterol [1]. Smooth muscle cells begin to migrate
	into the lesion, stimulated by growth factors released by macrophages,
	platelets (which may have thrombosed beneath an area of endothelial
	injury), endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells [3]. This inflammatory
	process results in modified LDL that is taken up by macrophages or
	smooth muscle cells, leading to the formation of foam cells. The
	accumulation of foam cells and intercellular lipid in the intimal
	layer constitutes the first stage of atherosclerosis called the fatty
	streak. Many have considered the fatty streak to be the precursor
	of fibrous plaque formation; however, some lesions may not develop
	further [4]. Virmani et al [5] classify the fatty streak as intimal
	xanthomata, which refers to focal accumulations of fat-laden macrophages
	within the intima. We know that most intimal xanthomata will regress
	because the distribution of lesions in the third decade of life and
	beyond is very different from the fatty streaks seen in children
	[5]. Fibrous plaque is formed when smooth muscle cells produce a
	fibrous cap around the lipid core. The lipid core consists of an
	extracellular mass of cholesterol esters, and is lined by foam cells.
	The cholesterol esters accumulate as the foam cells consume more
	and more lipid, and eventually become necrotic and break apart, partly
	because of local hypoxia. The lesion grows by a continued inflammatory
	reaction along the shoulder regions adjacent to the edges of the
	lipid core. The final stage of atherosclerosis is the complicated
	atheroma, which is characterized by the presence of ulceration, intraplaque
	hemorrhage, thrombosis, and plates of calcification. Studies of coronary
	arteries have shown calcium granules begin deposition immediately
	with the formation of the lipid core, although plates and lumps of
	calcium form in more advanced lesions [4]. The complicated atheroma
	is frequently associated with a clinically acute event.},

	plaque stabilization is a promising clinical strategy to prevent
	cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).
	There is a correlation between coronary and carotid plaque instability,
	and echolucent plaques are recognized as vulnerable plaques. METHODS
	Consecutive nonhypercholesterolemic patients with CAD were randomly
	assigned Adult Treatment Panel-III diet therapy (diet group; n =
	30) or pravastatin (statin group; n = 30). Echolucent carotid plaques
	were monitored by measuring intima-media thickness (IMT) and echogenicity
	by IBS for six months. RESULTS Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein
	cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were
	significantly decreased in the statin group (from 197 +/- 15 mg/dl
	to 170 +/- 18 mg/dl [p < 0.001]; from 131 +/- 14 mg/dl to 99 +/-
	14 mg/dl [p < 0.001]; and from 0.11 [0.04 to 0.22] mg/dl to 0.06
	[0.04 to 0.11] mg/dl [p < 0.05]; respectively), whereas only total
	cholesterol was moderately reduced (from 193 +/- 24 mg/dl to 185
	+/- 22 mg/dl [p < 0.05]) and LDL-C and triglycerides insignificantly
	reduced in the diet group. Significant increases of echogenicity
	of carotid plaques were noted in the statin group but not in the
	diet group (from -18.5 +/- 4.1 dB to -15.9 +/- 3.7 dB [p < 0.001]
	and from -18.2 +/- 4.0 dB to -18.9 +/- 3.5 dB [p = 0.13]; respectively)
	without significant regression of plaque-IMT values in both groups.
	CONCLUSIONS Statin therapy is rapidly effective in increasing echogenicity
	of vulnerable plaques without regression of plaque size in nonhypercholesterolemic
	patients with CAD. Quantitative assessment of carotid plaque quality
	by ultrasound with IBS is clinically useful for monitoring atherosclerotic
	lesions by evaluating vulnerability of atheroma.},

	Consequently, different investigators using different measurement

	to model the effects of frequency-dependent attenuation and dispersion
	on transit-time-based SOS estimates. The numerical technique is based
	on a previously developed linear system analytic model for Gaussian
	pulses propagating through linearly attenuating, weakly dispersive
	media. The numerical approach is somewhat more general in that it
	can be used to predict the effects of arbitrary pulse shapes and
	dispersion relationships. The numerical technique, however, utilizes
	several additional assumptions (compared with the analytic model)
	which would be required for the practical task of correcting existing
	clinical databases. These include a single dispersion relationship
	for all calcaneus samples, a simple linear model relating phase velocity
	to broadband ultrasonic attenuation, and a constant calcaneal thickness.
	Measurements on a polycarbonate plate and 30 human calcaneus samples
	were in good quantitative agreement with numerical predictions. In
	addition, the numerical approach predicts that in cancellous bone,
	frequency-dependent attenuation tends to be a greater contributor
	to variations ire transit-time-based SOS estimates than dispersion.
	This approach may be used to adjust previously acquired individual
	measurements so that SOS data recorded with different devices using

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: As are the attenuation coefficient and sound speed, the
	backscatter coefficient is a fundamental ultrasonic property that
	has been used to characterize many tissues. Unfortunately, there
	is currently far less standardization for the ultrasonic backscatter
	measurement than for the other two, as evidenced by a previous American
	Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM)-sponsored interlaboratory
	comparison of ultrasonic backscatter, attenuation, and speed measurements
	(J Ultrasound Med 1999; 18:615-631). To explore reasons for these
	disparities, the AIUM Endowment for Education and Research recently
	supported this second interlaboratory comparison, which extends the
	upper limit of the frequency range from 7 to 9 MHz. METHODS: Eleven
	laboratories were provided with standard test objects designed and
	manufactured at the University of Wisconsin (Madison, WI). Each laboratory
	was asked to perform ultrasonic measurements of sound speed, attenuation
	coefficients, and backscatter coefficients. Each laboratory was blinded
	to the values of the ultrasonic properties of the test objects at
	the time the measurements were performed. RESULTS: Eight of the 11
	laboratories submitted results. The range of variation of absolute
	magnitude of backscatter coefficient measurements was about 2 orders
	of magnitude. If the results of 1 outlier laboratory are excluded,
	then the range is reduced to about 1 order of magnitude. Agreement
	regarding frequency dependence of backscatter was better than reported
	in the previous interlaboratory comparison. For example, when scatterers
	were small compared with the ultrasonic wavelength, experimental
	frequency-dependent backscatter coefficient data obtained by the
	participating laboratories were usually consistent with the expected

	subjects and two atherosclerosis patients were scanned in 1.5T and
	3T scanners with a similar protocol providing transverse T1-, T2-,
	and proton density (PD)-weighted black-blood images using a fast
	spin-echo sequence with single- (T1-weighted) or multislice (PD-/T2-weighted)

	ratio (SNR) and wall/lumen contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were compared
	in 44 artery cross-sections by paired t-test. Interscanner variability
	of the lumen area (LA), wall area (WA), and mean wall thickness (MWT)
	was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: Wall SNR and lumen/wall
	CNR significantly increased (P < 0.0001) at 3T with a 1.5-fold gain
	for T1-weighted images and a 1.7/1.8-fold gain for PD-/T2-weighted
	images. Lumen SNR did not differ for single-slice DIR T1-weighted
	images (P = 0.2), but was larger at 3T for multislice DIR PD-/T2-weighted
	images (P = 0.01/0.03). The LA, WA, and MWT demonstrated good agreement
	with no significant bias (P 0.5), a coefficient of variation (CV)
	of < 10\%, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of > 0.95.
	CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated significant improvement in SNR,
	CNR, and image quality for high- resolution black-blood imaging of
	carotid arteries at 3T. Morphologic measurements are compatible between

	has been developed that addresses the inherent trade-offs associated

	multilevel block matching (MLBM) algorithm uses variable matching
	block and search window sizes in a coarse-to-fine scheme, preserving
	the relative immunity to noise associated with the use of a large
	matching block while preserving the motion field detail associated
	with the use of a small matching block. To decrease further the sensitivity
	of the multilevel approach to noise, speckle decorrelation and false
	matches, a smooth motion model-based block matching (SMBM) algorithm
	has been implemented that takes into account the spatial inertia
	of soft tissue elements. The new algorithms were compared to SLBM
	through a series of experiments involving manual translation of soft
	tissue phantoms, motion field computer simulations of rotation, compression
	and shear deformation, and an experiment involving contraction of
	human forearm muscles. Measures of tracking accuracy included mean
	squared tracking error, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and blinded
	observations of optical flow. Measures of tracking efficiency included
	the number of sum squared difference calculations and the computation
	time. In the phantom translation experiments, the SMBM algorithm
	successfully matched the accuracy of SLBM using both large and small
	matching blocks while significantly reducing the number of computations
	and computation time when a large matching block was used. For the
	computer simulations, SMBM yielded better tracking accuracies and
	spatial resolution when compared with SLBM using a large matching
	block. For the muscle experiment, SMBM outperformed SLBM both in
	terms of PSNR and observations of optical flow. We believe that the

  abstract = {Numerous epidemiologic observations reporting high prevalence of migraine
	among young individuals with stroke as well as dysfunction of cerebral
	arteries during migraine attacks prompt speculation on the existence
	of a comorbidity between the two disorders. The recent finding of
	silent infarct-like brain lesions in migraineurs reinforced this
	hypothesis and raised questions on whether migraine may be a progressive
	disorder rather than simply an episodic disorder. Stroke can occur
	during the course of migraine attacks with aura, supporting the assumption
	of a causal relation between the two diseases. Migraine may accentuate
	other existing risk factors for stroke, and both jointly increase
	the risk of cerebral ischemia outside of migraine attacks. In this
	regard, the role of migraine might be that of predisposing condition
	for cerebral ischemia. Migraine and ischemic stroke may be the end
	phenotype of common pathogenic mechanisms. Evidence of a migraine-stroke
	relation in cases of specific disorders, such as CADASIL (cerebral
	autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy)
	and MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis,
	and stroke-like episodes), strongly supports this concept. Finally,
	acute focal cerebral ischemia can trigger migraine attacks, and,
	thus, migraine may be the consequence of stroke. In this paper, we
	will review contemporary epidemiologic studies, discuss potential
	mechanisms of migraine-induced stroke and comorbid ischemic stroke,

	micro-embolisation, may be associated with an increased risk of stroke.
	However, the relationship between carotid plaque ultrasound characteristics
	and micro-embolic signals (MES) detected in the middle cerebral artery
	(MCA) is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate
	the prevalence of MES in patients with symptomatic high-grade internal
	carotid artery (ICA) stenosis and to identify predisposing factors,
	such as plaque echogenicity and intra stenotic blood flow velocity
	pattern. METHODS: 197 patients (mean age 69.5+/-8.6, 161 males) with
	confirmed symptomatic high-grade ICA stenosis and anti-platelet treatment
	underwent bilateral MES monitoring for 30 minutes within the anterior
	circulation, using Power M-mode transcranial Doppler techniques (TCD).
	Carotid artery plaques were characterized by Gray-Weale scaling.
	RESULTS: In 32.0\% of the patients, we detected MES by TCD within
	the MCA on the symptomatic side, but the same finding was made in
	only 4.5\% on the corresponding asymptomatic site (p<0.0001). The
	presence or absence of MES was associated with neither ultrasonic
	plaque characteristics nor the intrastenotic blood flow velocities
	at peak systole and end diastole. The median time since the last
	ischemic event symptoms was shorter in the patient group with MES
	[+] than in MES [-] (p=0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Despite optimum standard
	anti-platelet therapy, cerebral micro-embolisation occurs in 30\%
	of patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease, which might
	therefore be a possible risk factor for recurrent neurological symptoms.
	However, the presence of MES is independent of intrastenotic blood
	flow disturbances and grey scale ultrasound plaque characteristics.
	The presence of MES as an indicator of unstable plaque and thereby
	a possible risk factor for stroke should be evaluated prospectively
	using various algorithms for plaque classifications.},

	December 1987 and December 1993, a total of 1662 patients with asymptomatic
	carotid artery stenosis of 60\% or greater reduction in diameter
	were randomized; follow-up data are available on 1659. At baseline,

	transient ischemic attack or cerebral infarction occurring in the
	distribution of the study artery and any transient ischemic attack,
	stroke, or death occurring in the perioperative period. In March
	1993, the primary outcome measures were changed to cerebral infarction

	(p = 0.01) and patients with recent symptoms more soft tissue than
	patients with earlier symptoms (p = 0.004). There was no correlation

	points were assessed by blinded, independent case review. No patient
	was lost to follow-up. RESULTS. Life-table estimates of the cumulative
	risk of any ipsilateral stroke at two years were 26 percent in the
	331 medical patients and 9 percent in the 328 surgical patients--an
	absolute risk reduction (+/- SE) 17 +/- 3.5 percent (P less than
	0.001). For a major or fatal ipsilateral stroke, the corresponding
	estimates were 13.1 percent and 2.5 percent--an absolute risk reduction
	of 10.6 +/- 2.6 percent (P less than 0.001). Carotid endarterectomy
	was still found to be beneficial when all strokes and deaths were
	included in the analysis (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Carotid
	endarterectomy is highly beneficial to patients with recent hemispheric
	and retinal transient ischemic attacks or nondisabling strokes and
	ipsilateral high-grade stenosis (70 to 99 percent) of the internal
	carotid artery.},
