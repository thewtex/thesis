  abstract = {Atherosclerosis is now considered a systemic inflammatory disorder
	affecting the arterial tree. Inflammation plays a role in all stages
	of the disease, from the initiation of the fatty streak to the final
	stage of plaque rupture. Atherosclerotic plaques that demonstrate
	the features of active inflammation are more likely to become symptomatic.
	In addition to having a higher risk of developing adverse cardiovascular
	events, patients who have higher indices of inflammation may be more
	likely to develop restenosis after endovascular stenting. Thus, the
	identification of the 'inflamed plaque' is the subject of intense
	research. The detection of the inflamed plaque by the conventional
	modalities of ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography
	and nuclear medicine as well as the novel imaging modalities of optical
	coherence tomography, near-infrared spectroscopy, thermography and
	angioscopy will be examined.},

  abstract = {It is well accepted that atherosclerosis initiation and progression
	correlate positively with low and oscillating flow wall shear stresses
	(FSS). However, this mechanism cannot explain why advanced plaques
	continue to grow under elevated FSS conditions. In vivo magnetic
	resonance imaging (MRI)-based 2D/3D multi-component models with fluid-structure
	interactions (FSI, 3D only) for human carotid atherosclerotic plaques
	were introduced to quantify correlations between plaque progression
	measured by wall thickness increase (WTI) and plaque wall (structure)
	stress (PWS) conditions. A histologically validated multi-contrast
	MRI protocol was used to acquire multi-year in vivo MRI images. Our
	results using 2D models (200-700 data points/patient) indicated that
	18 out of 21 patients studied showed significant negative correlation
	between WTI and PWS at time 2 (T2). The 95\% confidence interval
	for the Pearson correlation coefficient is (-0.443,-0.246), p<0.0001.
	Our 3D FSI model supported the 2D correlation results and further
	indicated that combining both plaque structure stress and flow shear
	stress gave better approximation results (PWS, T2: R(2)=0.279; FSS,
	T1: R(2)=0.276; combining both: R(2)=0.637). These pilot studies
	suggest that both lower PWS and lower FSS may contribute to continued
	plaque progression and should be taken into consideration in future
	investigations of diseases related to atherosclerosis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Given the importance of inflammation in atherosclerosis,
	we sought to determine if atherosclerotic plaque inflammation could
	be measured noninvasively in humans using positron emission tomography
	(PET). BACKGROUND: Earlier PET studies using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
	demonstrated increased FDG uptake in atherosclerotic plaques. Here
	we tested the ability of FDG-PET to measure carotid plaque inflammation
	in patients who subsequently underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
	METHODS: Seventeen patients with severe carotid stenoses underwent
	FDG-PET imaging 3 h after FDG administration (13 to 25 mCi), after
	which carotid plaque FDG uptake was determined as the ratio of plaque
	to blood activity (target to background ratio, TBR). Less than 1
	month after imaging, subjects underwent CEA, after which carotid
	specimens were processed to identify macrophages (staining with anti-CD68
	antibodies). RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between
	the PET signal from the carotid plaques and the macrophage staining
	from the corresponding histologic sections (r = 0.70; p < 0.0001).
	When mean FDG uptake (mean TBR) was compared with mean inflammation
	(mean percentage CD68 staining) for each of the 17 patients, the
	correlation was even stronger (r = 0.85; p < 0.0001). Fluorodeoxyglucose
	uptake did not correlate with plaque area, plaque thickness, or area
	of smooth muscle cell staining. CONCLUSIONS: We established that
	FDG-PET imaging can be used to assess the severity of inflammation
	in carotid plaques in patients. If subsequent natural history studies
	link increased FDG-PET activity in carotid arteries with clinical
	events, this noninvasive measure could be used to identify a subset
	of patients with carotid atherosclerosis in need of intensified medical
	therapy or carotid artery intervention to prevent stroke.},

	the mechanical response of the diseased tissue. Failure rates associated

	plaque should be known; yet data are scant. The purpose of this study
	was to investigate the different mechanical responses exhibited by
	plaques with different compositions, focusing specifically on radial
	compressive behavior. A custom-built experimental system was developed
	that was fully computer controlled with a broad range of loading
	capabilities. A temperature-controlled, physiologic specimen bath
	allowed testing at 37 degrees C. Monotonically loaded specimens showed
	that plaque behavior was nonlinear under finite deformations. A multiple
	cycle protocol, executed in two phases, distinguished three types
	of mechanical response of different plaques. The differences in behavior
	were associated with histologic differences in plaque composition,
	and mechanically characterized by different ''repeatability'' (the
	stabilization of the cyclic response) and ''recoverability'' (the
	second loading phase retracing the first loading phase behavior).
	Type 1 behavior was categorized by repeatability and recoverability
	. Type 2 behavior displayed repeatability but only partial recovery
	during the second loading phase. Recovery was absent in type 3 behavior.
	The histologic observations demonstrated that calcified tissue was
	present only in specimens displaying type 1 behavior. Fibrous tissue
	and part of a modified media (due to disease) were present in specimens
	displaying type 2 behavior. An atheroma, along with a relatively
	thin modified media, was present in specimens displaying type 3 behavior.
	The differences in the maximum stretches attained at the end of phase
	I loading, the stretch offset from the first to the 15th cycle of
	phase I loading, and the hysteresis in the first and 15th cycles
	of phase I loading distinguished the specimen behaviors with statistical
	significance. These compression data showed that plaques exhibit
	composition- and history-dependent nonlinear and inelastic responses

	five asymptomatic) individuals underwent plaque characterization
	magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Plaque geometry and composition
	were determined by multisequence review. Intrinsic plaque stress
	profiles were generated from 3D meshes by using finite element computational
	analysis. Differences in principal (shear) stress between normal
	and diseased sections of the carotid artery and between symptomatic
	and asymptomatic plaques were noted. RESULTS: There was a significant
	difference in peak principal stress between diseased and nondiseased
	segments of the artery (mean difference 537.65 kPa, p < 0.05). Symptomatic
	plaques had higher mean stresses than asymptomatic plaques (627.6
	kPa compared with 370.2 kPa, p = 0.05), which were independent of
	luminal stenosis and plaque composition. CONCLUSION: Significant
	differences in plaque stress exist between plaques from symptomatic

	were imaged with 1.5-T and 3.0-T MR imaging units with bilateral

	dichotomous variables. RESULTS: There was a strong level of agreement
	between field strengths for all morphologic variables, with ICCs
	ranging from 0.88 to 0.96. Agreement in the identification of presence
	or absence of plaque components was very good for calcification (kappa

	measured significantly (P = .03) larger at 3.0 T, while lipid-rich
	necrotic cores without hemorrhage were similar between field strengths
	(P = .9). CONCLUSION: At higher field strengths, the increased susceptibility
	of calcification and paramagnetic ferric iron in hemorrhage may alter
	quantification and/or detection. Nevertheless, imaging criteria at

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The ultrasonic image can offer unique information
	on the composition of atherosclerotic plaque, ie, the relative content
	of lipids, fibrous tissue, and calcific deposits. To date, however,
	the echographic assessment of plaque structure is based on a subjective,
	qualitative evaluation of the bidimensional images. We evaluated
	the feasibility and accuracy of assessing, in vivo, the acoustic
	properties of arterial carotid plaques by means of a suitably modified
	echographic apparatus allowing direct access to the radiofrequency
	signal. METHODS: In 15 patients undergoing carotid thromboendarterectomy,
	the ultrasonic findings in 70 discrete sites (within the plaque,
	n = 54; normal sites, n = 11; or intraluminal thrombi, n = 5) were
	correlated with the histological analysis (hematoxylin-eosin and
	Mallory trichrome stains) independently performed on the arterial
	samples. The pathological examination was carried out at a similar
	level of the insonation; the sites analyzed within the plaque were
	chosen because of their uniform echoic characteristics. In each ultrasonic
	region of interest selected from the echographic image, the integrated
	amplitude of the rectified radiofrequency signal was measured as
	the integrated backscatter index. RESULTS: The intimal-medial layer
	of normal carotid wall (n = 11) exhibited values of -32.5 +/- 9.4
	dB. The integrated backscatter index in fatty sites (n = 11, -40.3
	+/- 5.4 dB) differed from that of fibrous (n = 12, -23.8 +/- 5.0
	dB) and calcified (n = 26, -11.5 +/- 5.2 dB, P < .01 for all intergroup
	differences) sites. Intraluminal thrombotic sites (n = 5, -42 +/-
	5.1 dB, P < .01) differed from fibrous and calcified subsets (P <
	.01) but overlapped (P = NS) with fatty sites. Histological sampling
	also showed two sites of intraplaque hemorrhage that exhibited very
	low backscatter values (-53 and -58 dB) and three fibrofatty sites
	showing backscatter values (-28, -28, and -32 dB) intermediate between
	the fibrous and the fatty subsets. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative analysis
	of integrated backscatter of the arterial wall is feasible in humans
	and provides an operator-independent assessment of plaque echoic
	structure. In particular, integrated backscatter is effective in
	distinguishing lipidic, fibrotic, and calcific components in human

  title = {Current imaging modalities to visualize vulnerability within the
	atherosclerotic carotid plaque.},
  journal = {J Vasc Surg},
  year = {2008},
  month = {Sep},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that plaque vulnerability,
	rather than the degree of stenosis, is important in predicting the
	occurrence of subsequent cerebral ischemic events in patients with
	carotid artery stenosis. The many imaging modalities currently available
	have different properties with regard to the visualization of the
	extent of vulnerability in carotid plaque formation. METHODS: Original
	published studies were identified using the MEDLINE database (January
	1966 to March 2008). Manual cross-referencing was also performed.
	RESULTS: There is no single imaging modality that can produce definitive
	information about the state of vulnerability of an atherosclerotic
	plaque. Each has its own specific drawbacks, which may be the use
	of ionizing radiation or nephrotoxic contrast agents, an invasive
	character, low patient tolerability, or simply the paucity of information
	obtained on plaque vulnerability. Functional molecular imaging techniques
	such as positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission-computed
	tomography (SPECT) and near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) do seem
	able accurately to visualize and even quantify features of plaque
	vulnerability and its pathophysiologic processes. Promising new techniques
	like near infra-red fluorescence imaging are being developed and
	may be beneficial in this field. CONCLUSION: There is a promising

  abstract = {Histological abnormalities of the atherosclerotic lesion are closely
	related to the stability of the plaque. Specifically, the plaque
	is likely to be unstable if the fibrous cap is thin. However, ultrasonic
	characterization of the atherosclerotic lesion has not been done
	from this viewpoint. Thus, in the present study ultrasonic tissue
	characterization of the carotid atherosclerotic lesion was attempted
	to assess the stability of the plaque. Integrated ultrasonic backscatter
	(IBS) in the atherosclerotic lesion was compared with histological
	findings of the respective tissue in 35 patients with carotid artery
	stenosis who underwent carotid endarterectomy. Carotid IBS was determined
	by locating the region-of-interest (ROI) in the center of the atherosclerotic
	lesion and calibrating by subtracting the IBS in the tunica externa
	of the vessel from the IBS of the ROI. IBS was also determined at
	the interface of the plaque, and at this site it was analyzed in
	relation to the thickness of the fibrous cap. Lipid content, fibrous
	tissue, thrombus, hemorrhage and calcification were histologically
	assessed in the respective tissue. Carotid IBS in the lipid lesion
	(-22.5+/-4.1 dB) was significantly different from that of fibrous,
	hemorrhagic or calcified lesions (-11.1+/-7.1, -27.5+/-4.1, +2.1+/-6.5
	dB, respectively), but there was no significant difference in IBS
	between the lipid lesion and thrombus (-15.2+/-8.8 dB). IBS was lower
	in the thin fibrous cap than in the thick lesion (-10.9+/-6.4 vs
	-2.4+/-6.2 dB, p<0.001). IBS can be used to characterize atherosclerotic
	lesions in the carotid artery; a low value at the interface suggests
	a thin fibrous cap, which is frequently associated with unstable

	efficacy of CT angiography for the characterization of plaque morphology
	and composition in carotid atherosclerotic disease. METHODS: Fifty-five
	patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were imaged preoperatively
	with single-slice spiral CT angiography. One hundred sixty-five endarterectomy
	sections were examined histologically at selected levels through
	the distal common and proximal internal carotid arteries. Plaque
	density was measured (in Hounsfield units) on axial CT sections,
	and the presence or absence of ulceration was noted. These observations
	were compared with the histological findings at corresponding levels.
	Data were analyzed with 2-sample t tests and 1-way analysis of variance
	(ANOVA). RESULTS: ANOVA testing showed a statistically significant
	decrease in CT attenuation values with increasing plaque lipid but
	with a very high standard deviation of values. No other histological
	factor showed a statistically significant link with CT attenuation.
	Plaque ulceration was detected by CT with a sensitivity of 60\% and
	a specificity of 74\%. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of plaque attenuation
	with single-slice spiral CT does not give useful information concerning
	plaque composition. The predictive value of CT for the detection
	of plaque ulceration was moderate. Single-slice CT angiography is
	insufficiently robust to be a useful tool for the characterization
	of carotid plaque composition and morphology.},

	secondary stroke prevention. Non-invasive imaging, now widely available,
	is replacing intra-arterial angiography for carotid stenosis, but
	the accuracy remains uncertain despite an extensive literature. We
	systematically reviewed the accuracy of non-invasive imaging compared
	with intra-arterial angiography for diagnosing carotid stenosis in
	patients with carotid territory ischaemic symptoms.Methods We searched
	for articles published between 1980 and April 2004; included studies
	comparing non-invasive imaging with intra-arterial angiography that
	met Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) criteria;
	extracted data to calculate sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive
	imaging, to test for heterogeneity and to perform sensitivity analyses;
	and categorised percent stenosis by the North American Symptomatic
	Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) method.Results In 41 included
	studies (2541 patients, 4876 arteries), contrast-enhanced MR angiography
	was more sensitive (0·94, 95\% CI 0·88-0·97) and specific (0·93,
	95\% CI 0·89-0·96) for 70-99\% stenosis than Doppler ultrasound,
	MR angiography, and CT angiography (sensitivities 0·89, 0·88, 0·76;
	specificities 0·84, 0·84, 0·94, respectively). Data for 50-69\% stenoses
	and combinations of non-invasive tests were sparse and unreliable.
	There was heterogeneity between studies and evidence of publication
	bias.Interpretation Non-invasive tests, used cautiously, could replace
	intra-arterial carotid angiography for 70-99\% stenosis. However,
	more data are required to determine their accuracy, especially at
	50-69\% stenoses where the balance of risk and benefit for carotid
	endarterectomy is particularly narrow, and to explore and overcome
	heterogeneity. Methodology for evaluating imaging tests should be

  abstract = {Plaque formation begins with the transportation of lipoproteins into
	the arterial wall. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) carries most of
	the cholesterol in human plasma and becomes trapped within the subendothelial
	space of the wall. First, the lipid component of LDL is oxidized,
	and this process attracts monocytes to enter the wall and become
	macrophages, which further the oxidative process [1]. High-density
	lipoprotein (HDL) has been shown to inhibit this oxidative process
	[2], thereby providing protection against atherogenesis. Macrophages
	also modify the surface protein of LDL, apoprotein B, making it unrecognizable
	by the LDL receptor and leading to dysregulation with resultant massive
	accumulation of cholesterol [1]. Smooth muscle cells begin to migrate
	into the lesion, stimulated by growth factors released by macrophages,
	platelets (which may have thrombosed beneath an area of endothelial
	injury), endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells [3]. This inflammatory
	process results in modified LDL that is taken up by macrophages or
	smooth muscle cells, leading to the formation of foam cells. The
	accumulation of foam cells and intercellular lipid in the intimal
	layer constitutes the first stage of atherosclerosis called the fatty
	streak. Many have considered the fatty streak to be the precursor
	of fibrous plaque formation; however, some lesions may not develop
	further [4]. Virmani et al [5] classify the fatty streak as intimal
	xanthomata, which refers to focal accumulations of fat-laden macrophages
	within the intima. We know that most intimal xanthomata will regress
	because the distribution of lesions in the third decade of life and
	beyond is very different from the fatty streaks seen in children
	[5]. Fibrous plaque is formed when smooth muscle cells produce a
	fibrous cap around the lipid core. The lipid core consists of an
	extracellular mass of cholesterol esters, and is lined by foam cells.
	The cholesterol esters accumulate as the foam cells consume more
	and more lipid, and eventually become necrotic and break apart, partly
	because of local hypoxia. The lesion grows by a continued inflammatory
	reaction along the shoulder regions adjacent to the edges of the
	lipid core. The final stage of atherosclerosis is the complicated
	atheroma, which is characterized by the presence of ulceration, intraplaque
	hemorrhage, thrombosis, and plates of calcification. Studies of coronary
	arteries have shown calcium granules begin deposition immediately
	with the formation of the lipid core, although plates and lumps of
	calcium form in more advanced lesions [4]. The complicated atheroma
	is frequently associated with a clinically acute event.},

	plaque stabilization is a promising clinical strategy to prevent
	cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).
	There is a correlation between coronary and carotid plaque instability,
	and echolucent plaques are recognized as vulnerable plaques. METHODS
	Consecutive nonhypercholesterolemic patients with CAD were randomly
	assigned Adult Treatment Panel-III diet therapy (diet group; n =
	30) or pravastatin (statin group; n = 30). Echolucent carotid plaques
	were monitored by measuring intima-media thickness (IMT) and echogenicity
	by IBS for six months. RESULTS Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein
	cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were
	significantly decreased in the statin group (from 197 +/- 15 mg/dl
	to 170 +/- 18 mg/dl [p < 0.001]; from 131 +/- 14 mg/dl to 99 +/-
	14 mg/dl [p < 0.001]; and from 0.11 [0.04 to 0.22] mg/dl to 0.06
	[0.04 to 0.11] mg/dl [p < 0.05]; respectively), whereas only total
	cholesterol was moderately reduced (from 193 +/- 24 mg/dl to 185
	+/- 22 mg/dl [p < 0.05]) and LDL-C and triglycerides insignificantly
	reduced in the diet group. Significant increases of echogenicity
	of carotid plaques were noted in the statin group but not in the
	diet group (from -18.5 +/- 4.1 dB to -15.9 +/- 3.7 dB [p < 0.001]
	and from -18.2 +/- 4.0 dB to -18.9 +/- 3.5 dB [p = 0.13]; respectively)
	without significant regression of plaque-IMT values in both groups.
	CONCLUSIONS Statin therapy is rapidly effective in increasing echogenicity
	of vulnerable plaques without regression of plaque size in nonhypercholesterolemic
	patients with CAD. Quantitative assessment of carotid plaque quality
	by ultrasound with IBS is clinically useful for monitoring atherosclerotic
	lesions by evaluating vulnerability of atheroma.},

	Consequently, different investigators using different measurement
	systems and analysis algorithms obtain disparate quantitative values
	for calcaneal SOS, impairing and often precluding meaningful comparison
	and/or pooling of measurements. A numerical method has been developed
	to model the effects of frequency-dependent attenuation and dispersion
	on transit-time-based SOS estimates. The numerical technique is based
	on a previously developed linear system analytic model for Gaussian
	pulses propagating through linearly attenuating, weakly dispersive
	media. The numerical approach is somewhat more general in that it
	can be used to predict the effects of arbitrary pulse shapes and
	dispersion relationships. The numerical technique, however, utilizes
	several additional assumptions (compared with the analytic model)
	which would be required for the practical task of correcting existing
	clinical databases. These include a single dispersion relationship
	for all calcaneus samples, a simple linear model relating phase velocity
	to broadband ultrasonic attenuation, and a constant calcaneal thickness.
	Measurements on a polycarbonate plate and 30 human calcaneus samples
	were in good quantitative agreement with numerical predictions. In
	addition, the numerical approach predicts that in cancellous bone,
	frequency-dependent attenuation tends to be a greater contributor
	to variations ire transit-time-based SOS estimates than dispersion.
	This approach may be used to adjust previously acquired individual
	measurements so that SOS data recorded with different devices using
	different algorithms may be compared in a meaningful fashion.}},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: As are the attenuation coefficient and sound speed, the
	backscatter coefficient is a fundamental ultrasonic property that
	has been used to characterize many tissues. Unfortunately, there
	is currently far less standardization for the ultrasonic backscatter
	measurement than for the other two, as evidenced by a previous American
	Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM)-sponsored interlaboratory
	comparison of ultrasonic backscatter, attenuation, and speed measurements
	(J Ultrasound Med 1999; 18:615-631). To explore reasons for these
	disparities, the AIUM Endowment for Education and Research recently
	supported this second interlaboratory comparison, which extends the
	upper limit of the frequency range from 7 to 9 MHz. METHODS: Eleven
	laboratories were provided with standard test objects designed and
	manufactured at the University of Wisconsin (Madison, WI). Each laboratory
	was asked to perform ultrasonic measurements of sound speed, attenuation
	coefficients, and backscatter coefficients. Each laboratory was blinded
	to the values of the ultrasonic properties of the test objects at
	the time the measurements were performed. RESULTS: Eight of the 11
	laboratories submitted results. The range of variation of absolute
	magnitude of backscatter coefficient measurements was about 2 orders
	of magnitude. If the results of 1 outlier laboratory are excluded,
	then the range is reduced to about 1 order of magnitude. Agreement
	regarding frequency dependence of backscatter was better than reported
	in the previous interlaboratory comparison. For example, when scatterers
	were small compared with the ultrasonic wavelength, experimental
	frequency-dependent backscatter coefficient data obtained by the
	participating laboratories were usually consistent with the expected
	Rayleigh scattering behavior (proportional to frequency to the fourth
	power). CONCLUSIONS: Greater standardization of backscatter measurement
	methods is needed. Measurements of frequency dependence of backscatter
	are more consistent than measurements of absolute magnitude.},

  abstract = {The cardiovascular system is an internal flow loop with multiple branches
	circulating a complex liquid. The hallmarks of blood flow in arteries
	are pulsatility and branches, which cause wail stresses to be cyclical
	and nonuniform. Normal arterial flow is laminar, with secondary flows
	generated at curves and branches. Arteries can adapt to and modify
	hemodynamic conditions, and unusual hemodynamic conditions may cause
	an abnormal biological response. Velocity profile skewing can create
	pockets in which the wall shear stress is low and oscillates in direction.
	Atherosclerosis tends to localize to these sites and creates a narrowing
	of the artery lumen-a stenosis. Plaque rupture or endothelial injury
	can stimulate thrombosis, which can block blood flow to heart or
	brain tissues, causing a heart attack or stroke. The small lumen
	and elevated shear rate in a stenosis create conditions that accelerate
	platelet accumulation and occlusion. The relationship between thrombosis
	and fluid mechanics is complex, especially in the post-stenotic flow
	field. New convection models have been developed to predict clinical
	occlusion from platelet thrombosis in diseased arteries. Future hemodynamic
	studies should address the complex mechanics of flow-induced, large-scale
	wall motion and convection of semisolid particles and cells in flowing
	blood.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare black-blood multicontrast carotid imaging at 3T
	and 1.5T and assess compatibility between morphological measurements
	of carotid arteries at 1.5T and 3T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five healthy
	subjects and two atherosclerosis patients were scanned in 1.5T and
	3T scanners with a similar protocol providing transverse T1-, T2-,
	and proton density (PD)-weighted black-blood images using a fast
	spin-echo sequence with single- (T1-weighted) or multislice (PD-/T2-weighted)
	double inversion recovery (DIR) preparation. Wall and lumen signal-to-noise
	ratio (SNR) and wall/lumen contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were compared
	in 44 artery cross-sections by paired t-test. Interscanner variability
	of the lumen area (LA), wall area (WA), and mean wall thickness (MWT)
	was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: Wall SNR and lumen/wall
	CNR significantly increased (P < 0.0001) at 3T with a 1.5-fold gain
	for T1-weighted images and a 1.7/1.8-fold gain for PD-/T2-weighted
	images. Lumen SNR did not differ for single-slice DIR T1-weighted
	images (P = 0.2), but was larger at 3T for multislice DIR PD-/T2-weighted
	images (P = 0.01/0.03). The LA, WA, and MWT demonstrated good agreement
	with no significant bias (P 0.5), a coefficient of variation (CV)
	of < 10\%, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of > 0.95.
	CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated significant improvement in SNR,
	CNR, and image quality for high- resolution black-blood imaging of
	carotid arteries at 3T. Morphologic measurements are compatible between
	1.5T and 3T.},

  abstract = {A multilevel motion model-based approach to ultrasonic speckle tracking
	has been developed that addresses the inherent trade-offs associated
	with traditional single-level block matching (SLBM) methods. The
	multilevel block matching (MLBM) algorithm uses variable matching
	block and search window sizes in a coarse-to-fine scheme, preserving
	the relative immunity to noise associated with the use of a large
	matching block while preserving the motion field detail associated
	with the use of a small matching block. To decrease further the sensitivity
	of the multilevel approach to noise, speckle decorrelation and false
	matches, a smooth motion model-based block matching (SMBM) algorithm
	has been implemented that takes into account the spatial inertia
	of soft tissue elements. The new algorithms were compared to SLBM
	through a series of experiments involving manual translation of soft
	tissue phantoms, motion field computer simulations of rotation, compression
	and shear deformation, and an experiment involving contraction of
	human forearm muscles. Measures of tracking accuracy included mean
	squared tracking error, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and blinded
	observations of optical flow. Measures of tracking efficiency included
	the number of sum squared difference calculations and the computation
	time. In the phantom translation experiments, the SMBM algorithm
	successfully matched the accuracy of SLBM using both large and small
	matching blocks while significantly reducing the number of computations
	and computation time when a large matching block was used. For the
	computer simulations, SMBM yielded better tracking accuracies and
	spatial resolution when compared with SLBM using a large matching
	block. For the muscle experiment, SMBM outperformed SLBM both in
	terms of PSNR and observations of optical flow. We believe that the
	smooth motion model-based MLBM approach represents a meaningful development
	in ultrasonic soft tissue motion measurement. (C) 1998 World Federation

  abstract = {Numerous epidemiologic observations reporting high prevalence of migraine
	among young individuals with stroke as well as dysfunction of cerebral
	arteries during migraine attacks prompt speculation on the existence
	of a comorbidity between the two disorders. The recent finding of
	silent infarct-like brain lesions in migraineurs reinforced this
	hypothesis and raised questions on whether migraine may be a progressive
	disorder rather than simply an episodic disorder. Stroke can occur
	during the course of migraine attacks with aura, supporting the assumption
	of a causal relation between the two diseases. Migraine may accentuate
	other existing risk factors for stroke, and both jointly increase
	the risk of cerebral ischemia outside of migraine attacks. In this
	regard, the role of migraine might be that of predisposing condition
	for cerebral ischemia. Migraine and ischemic stroke may be the end
	phenotype of common pathogenic mechanisms. Evidence of a migraine-stroke
	relation in cases of specific disorders, such as CADASIL (cerebral
	autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy)
	and MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis,
	and stroke-like episodes), strongly supports this concept. Finally,
	acute focal cerebral ischemia can trigger migraine attacks, and,
	thus, migraine may be the consequence of stroke. In this paper, we
	will review contemporary epidemiologic studies, discuss potential
	mechanisms of migraine-induced stroke and comorbid ischemic stroke,
	and pose new research questions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Echolucent carotid plaques, as well as downstream
	micro-embolisation, may be associated with an increased risk of stroke.
	However, the relationship between carotid plaque ultrasound characteristics
	and micro-embolic signals (MES) detected in the middle cerebral artery
	(MCA) is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate
	the prevalence of MES in patients with symptomatic high-grade internal
	carotid artery (ICA) stenosis and to identify predisposing factors,
	such as plaque echogenicity and intra stenotic blood flow velocity
	pattern. METHODS: 197 patients (mean age 69.5+/-8.6, 161 males) with
	confirmed symptomatic high-grade ICA stenosis and anti-platelet treatment
	underwent bilateral MES monitoring for 30 minutes within the anterior
	circulation, using Power M-mode transcranial Doppler techniques (TCD).
	Carotid artery plaques were characterized by Gray-Weale scaling.
	RESULTS: In 32.0\% of the patients, we detected MES by TCD within
	the MCA on the symptomatic side, but the same finding was made in
	only 4.5\% on the corresponding asymptomatic site (p<0.0001). The
	presence or absence of MES was associated with neither ultrasonic
	plaque characteristics nor the intrastenotic blood flow velocities
	at peak systole and end diastole. The median time since the last
	ischemic event symptoms was shorter in the patient group with MES
	[+] than in MES [-] (p=0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Despite optimum standard
	anti-platelet therapy, cerebral micro-embolisation occurs in 30\%
	of patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease, which might
	therefore be a possible risk factor for recurrent neurological symptoms.
	However, the presence of MES is independent of intrastenotic blood
	flow disturbances and grey scale ultrasound plaque characteristics.
	The presence of MES as an indicator of unstable plaque and thereby
	a possible risk factor for stroke should be evaluated prospectively
	using various algorithms for plaque classifications.},

	to aggressive medical management can reduce the incidence of cerebral

	DESIGN--Prospective, randomized, multicenter trial. SETTING--Thirty-nine
	clinical sites across the United States and Canada. PATIENTS--Between
	December 1987 and December 1993, a total of 1662 patients with asymptomatic
	carotid artery stenosis of 60\% or greater reduction in diameter
	were randomized; follow-up data are available on 1659. At baseline,
	recognized risk factors for stroke were similar between the two treatment
	groups. INTERVENTION--Daily aspirin administration and medical risk
	factor management for all patients; carotid endarterectomy for patients
	randomized to receive surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Initially,
	transient ischemic attack or cerebral infarction occurring in the
	distribution of the study artery and any transient ischemic attack,
	stroke, or death occurring in the perioperative period. In March
	1993, the primary outcome measures were changed to cerebral infarction
	occurring in the distribution of the study artery or any stroke or
	death occurring in the perioperative period. RESULTS--After a median
	follow-up of 2.7 years, with 4657 patient-years of observation, the
	aggregate risk over 5 years for ipsilateral stroke and any perioperative
	stroke or death was estimated to be 5.1\% for surgical patients and
	11.0\% for patients treated medically (aggregate risk reduction of
	53\% [95\% confidence interval, 22\% to 72\%]). CONCLUSION--Patients
	with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis of 60\% or greater reduction
	in diameter and whose general health makes them good candidates for
	elective surgery will have a reduced 5-year risk of ipsilateral stroke

	carotid endarterectomy. Perioperatively, macroscopic plaque features

	(p = 0.01) and patients with recent symptoms more soft tissue than
	patients with earlier symptoms (p = 0.004). There was no correlation

	whether carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of stroke among patients
	with a recent adverse cerebrovascular event and ipsilateral carotid
	stenosis. METHODS. We conducted a randomized trial at 50 clinical
	centers throughout the United States and Canada, in patients in two
	predetermined strata based on the severity of carotid stenosis--30
	to 69 percent and 70 to 99 percent. We report here the results in
	the 659 patients in the latter stratum, who had had a hemispheric
	or retinal transient ischemic attack or a nondisabling stroke within
	the 120 days before entry and had stenosis of 70 to 99 percent in
	the symptomatic carotid artery. All patients received optimal medical
	care, including antiplatelet therapy. Those assigned to surgical
	treatment underwent carotid endarterectomy performed by neurosurgeons
	or vascular surgeons. All patients were examined by neurologists
	1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after entry and then every 4 months. End
	points were assessed by blinded, independent case review. No patient
	was lost to follow-up. RESULTS. Life-table estimates of the cumulative
	risk of any ipsilateral stroke at two years were 26 percent in the
	331 medical patients and 9 percent in the 328 surgical patients--an
	absolute risk reduction (+/- SE) 17 +/- 3.5 percent (P less than
	0.001). For a major or fatal ipsilateral stroke, the corresponding
	estimates were 13.1 percent and 2.5 percent--an absolute risk reduction
	of 10.6 +/- 2.6 percent (P less than 0.001). Carotid endarterectomy
	was still found to be beneficial when all strokes and deaths were
	included in the analysis (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Carotid
	endarterectomy is highly beneficial to patients with recent hemispheric
	and retinal transient ischemic attacks or nondisabling strokes and
	ipsilateral high-grade stenosis (70 to 99 percent) of the internal
