  abstract = {OBJECTIVE--To determine whether the addition of carotid endarterectomy
	to aggressive medical management can reduce the incidence of cerebral
	infarction in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.
	DESIGN--Prospective, randomized, multicenter trial. SETTING--Thirty-nine
	clinical sites across the United States and Canada. PATIENTS--Between
	December 1987 and December 1993, a total of 1662 patients with asymptomatic
	carotid artery stenosis of 60\% or greater reduction in diameter
	were randomized; follow-up data are available on 1659. At baseline,
	recognized risk factors for stroke were similar between the two treatment
	groups. INTERVENTION--Daily aspirin administration and medical risk
	factor management for all patients; carotid endarterectomy for patients
	randomized to receive surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Initially,
	transient ischemic attack or cerebral infarction occurring in the
	distribution of the study artery and any transient ischemic attack,
	stroke, or death occurring in the perioperative period. In March
	1993, the primary outcome measures were changed to cerebral infarction
	occurring in the distribution of the study artery or any stroke or
	death occurring in the perioperative period. RESULTS--After a median
	follow-up of 2.7 years, with 4657 patient-years of observation, the
	aggregate risk over 5 years for ipsilateral stroke and any perioperative
	stroke or death was estimated to be 5.1\% for surgical patients and
	11.0\% for patients treated medically (aggregate risk reduction of
	53\% [95\% confidence interval, 22\% to 72\%]). CONCLUSION--Patients
	with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis of 60\% or greater reduction
	in diameter and whose general health makes them good candidates for
	elective surgery will have a reduced 5-year risk of ipsilateral stroke
	if carotid endarterectomy performed with less than 3\% perioperative
	morbidity and mortality is added to aggressive management of modifiable
	risk factors.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To correlate B-mode ultrasound findings to carotid plaque
	histology. DESIGN: European multicentre study (nine centres). MATERIAL
	AND METHODS: Clinical presentation and risk factors were recorded
	and preoperative ultrasound Duplex scanning with special emphasis
	on B-mode imaging studies was performed in 270 patients undergoing
	carotid endarterectomy. Perioperatively, macroscopic plaque features
	were evaluated and the removed specimens were analysed histologically
	for fibrous tissue, calcification and 'soft tissue' (primarily haemorrhage
	and lipid). RESULTS: Males had more soft tissue than females (p =
	0.0006), hypertensive patients less soft tissue than normotensive
	(p = 0.01) and patients with recent symptoms more soft tissue than
	patients with earlier symptoms (p = 0.004). There was no correlation
	between surface description on ultrasound images compared to the
	surface judged intraoperatively by the surgeon. Echogenicity on B-mode
	images was inversely related to soft tissue (p = 0.005) and calcification
	was directly related to echogenicity (p < 0.0001). Heterogeneous
	plaques contained more calcification than homogeneous (p = 0.003),
	however, there was no difference in content of soft tissue. CONCLUSION:
	Ultrasound B-mode characteristics are related to the histological
	composition of carotid artery plaques and to patient's history. These
	results may imply that patients with distant symptoms may be regarded
	and treated as asymptomatic patients whereas asymptomatic patients
	with echolucent plaques should be considered for carotid endarterectomy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. Without strong evidence of benefit, the use of carotid
	endarterectomy for prophylaxis against stroke rose dramatically until
	the mid-1980s, then declined. Our investigation sought to determine
	whether carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of stroke among patients
	with a recent adverse cerebrovascular event and ipsilateral carotid
	stenosis. METHODS. We conducted a randomized trial at 50 clinical
	centers throughout the United States and Canada, in patients in two
	predetermined strata based on the severity of carotid stenosis--30
	to 69 percent and 70 to 99 percent. We report here the results in
	the 659 patients in the latter stratum, who had had a hemispheric
	or retinal transient ischemic attack or a nondisabling stroke within
	the 120 days before entry and had stenosis of 70 to 99 percent in
	the symptomatic carotid artery. All patients received optimal medical
	care, including antiplatelet therapy. Those assigned to surgical
	treatment underwent carotid endarterectomy performed by neurosurgeons
	or vascular surgeons. All patients were examined by neurologists
	1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after entry and then every 4 months. End
	points were assessed by blinded, independent case review. No patient
	was lost to follow-up. RESULTS. Life-table estimates of the cumulative
	risk of any ipsilateral stroke at two years were 26 percent in the
	331 medical patients and 9 percent in the 328 surgical patients--an
	absolute risk reduction (+/- SE) 17 +/- 3.5 percent (P less than
	0.001). For a major or fatal ipsilateral stroke, the corresponding
	estimates were 13.1 percent and 2.5 percent--an absolute risk reduction
	of 10.6 +/- 2.6 percent (P less than 0.001). Carotid endarterectomy
	was still found to be beneficial when all strokes and deaths were
	included in the analysis (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Carotid
	endarterectomy is highly beneficial to patients with recent hemispheric
	and retinal transient ischemic attacks or nondisabling strokes and
	ipsilateral high-grade stenosis (70 to 99 percent) of the internal
	carotid artery.},
