  abstract = {PURPOSE: In carotid artery disease, correlation of carotid plaque
	morphology with the patient's presenting symptoms has drawn conflicting
	conclusions. The purpose of this series was to correlate carotid
	plaque characteristics with the presenting symptoms from a large
	cohort of patients who underwent operation for carotid artery disease.
	METHODS: From a series of 1252 consecutive patients who underwent
	carotid endarterectomy, presenting symptoms were divided into three
	groups: transiently symptomatic (transient ischemic attack [TIA]
	or amaurosis fugax), prior stroke, and asymptomatic. Plaque characteristics,
	including ulceration, intraplaque hemorrhage, and degree of stenosis,
	were recorded prospectively for 1008 procedures. All endarterectomy
	specimens were inspected during the procedure, and plaque characteristics
	were recorded immediately after operation. RESULTS: There was a higher
	incidence of plaque ulceration in the transiently symptomatic and
	prior stroke groups (391 of 508 [77\%] and 91 of 115 [79\%]) than
	in the asymptomatic cohort (231 of 385 [60\%]; p < 0.0001, chi2 test).
	There was no significant difference in the incidence of plaque hemorrhage
	between the transiently symptomatic and prior stroke patients compared
	with the asymptomatic patients. There was no statistical difference
	for ulcerated plaque or plaque hemorrhage between the transiently
	symptomatic and prior stroke group. Intraplaque hemorrhage occurred
	more frequently in patients with high-grade stenosis (90\% to 99\%)
	than in those with less than 90\% stenosis (202 of 299 [68\%] versus
	97 of 299 [32\%]; p = 0.01, chi2 test). CONCLUSIONS: On gross examination
	of the carotid specimen in the operating room, plaque ulceration
	correlates with an initial presentation of amaurosis fugax, TIA,
	or prior stroke compared with patients operated on for asymptomatic
	disease. The presence of intraplaque hemorrhage is associated with
	more advanced stenosis of the internal carotid artery. These findings
	suggest that plaque morphology does play an important role in the
	presentation of carotid artery disease.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: to correlate the echostructural characteristics of carotid
	plaques with neurological symptoms and cerebral infarcts. MATERIALS:
	one hundred and five plaques were studied in 74 patients by colour-flow
	duplex ultrasound: 39 were symptomatic and 37 were associated with
	brain infarction on CT scanning. METHODS: the images were digitalised
	for computer-assisted image standardisation and divided in homogenous
	(n=67) and heterogenous (n=38) groups. Parameters of the plaque image
	were analysed. RESULTS: global echogenicity was significantly lower
	in symptomatic and in CT(+)plaques (p<0.05). For homogenous plaques,
	an echogenic cap (EC) was visualised in 8.3\% of symptomatic vs.
	33.9\% of asymptomatic (p<0. 05) and in 7.7\% for plaques that were
	CT(+)vs. 37.7\% for CT(-)(p<0. 05). Surface disruption was visualised
	in 50\% of symptomatic vs. 8. 5\% of asymptomatic (p=0.002) and in
	46\% of CT(+)vs. 9.4\% of CT(-)plaques (p=0.002). For heterogenous
	plaques, the echolucent region was juxtaluminal in 67\% of symptomatic
	and CT(+)plaques vs. 33\% in asymptomatic and CT(-)(p<0.01). CONCLUSION:
	echolucent plaques are associated with a higher neurological risk.
	In homogenous plaques the absence of an echogenic cap and disruption
	of the plaque surface also correlates with symptoms. In heterogenous
	plaques, juxtaluminal location of the echolucent region is an additional
	marker of increased risk.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the association between incident (first) stroke
	and the echogenicity of internal carotid arterial plaque at ultrasonography
	(US). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 4, 886 individuals who,
	at baseline, were 65 years of age or older and without symptoms of
	cerebrovascular disease was followed up for an average of 3.3 years.
	Baseline clinical findings were from color Doppler and duplex US
	studies of the carotid arteries and a record of traditional risk
	factors: age, sex, presence of diabetes mellitus, pack-years of cigarette
	smoking, presence of hypertension, elevated systolic and diastolic
	blood pressure, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level.
	RESULTS: Incident strokes, excluding hemorrhagic strokes and strokes
	of cardiac origin, were seen in 104 individuals (2.1\%) at risk.
	Age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios for incident stroke were significant
	for hypoechoic plaque (odds ratio, 2.53; 95\% CI, 1,42,4.53). After
	controlling for risk factors in a Cox proportional hazards model,
	the relative risk (RR) of incident stroke was 1.72 (p = .015) for
	hypoechoic plaque and 2.32 (P = .004) for internal carotid arterial
	narrowing of at least 50\%. In addition, hypoechoic plaque (RR, 2.78;
	CI, 1.36,5.69) and 50\%-100\% stenosis (RR, 3.08; CI, 1.28, 7.41)
	were associated with ipsilateral, nonfatal stroke. CONCLUSION: In
	asymptomatic adults aged 65 years or older, that risk of incident
	stroke was associated with two US features: hypoechoic internal carotid
	arterial plaque and an estimated internal carotid arterial stenosis
	of 50\%-100\%.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is scant population-based evidence regarding
	extracranial carotid plaque surface irregularity and ischemic stroke.
	Using a prospective cohort design, we evaluated the association of
	carotid plaque surface irregularity and the risk of ischemic stroke
	in a multiethnic population. METHODS: High-resolution B-mode ultrasound
	of the carotid arteries was performed in 1939 stroke-free subjects
	(mean age 69+/-10.0 years; 59\% women; 53\% Hispanic, 25\% black,
	22\% white). Plaque was defined as a focal protrusion 50\% greater
	than the surrounding area and localized along the extracranial carotid
	tree (internal carotid artery/bifurcation vs common carotid artery).
	Plaque surface was categorized as regular or irregular. Cox proportional
	hazard models were used to assess the association of surface characteristics
	and the risk of ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Among 1939 total subjects,
	carotid plaque was visualized in 56.3\% (1 plaque: 21.6\%, >1 plaque:
	34.7\%, irregular plaque: 5.5\%). During a mean follow up of 6.2
	years after ultrasound examination, 69 ischemic strokes occurred.
	Unadjusted cumulative 5-year risks of ischemic stroke were: 1.3\%,
	3.0\%, and 8.5\% for no plaque, regular plaque, and irregular plaque,
	respectively. After adjusting for demographics, traditional vascular
	risk factors, degree of stenosis, and plaque thickness, presence
	of irregular plaque (vs no plaque) was independently associated with
	ischemic stroke (Hazard ratio, 3.1; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 8.5). CONCLUSIONS:
	The presence of irregular carotid plaque independently predicted
	ischemic stroke in a multiethnic cohort. Plaque surface irregularities
	assessed by B-mode ultrasonography may help identify intermediate-
	to high-risk individuals beyond their vascular risk assessed by the
	presence of traditional risk factors.},

  year = {2008},
  volume = {42},
  pages = {167--173},
  abstract = {Transcranial Doppler is an innovative, flexible, accessible tool for
	the bedside monitoring of static and dynamic cerebral flow and treatment
	response. Introduced by Rune Aaslid in 1982, it has become indispensable
	in clinical practice. The main obstacle to ultrasound penetration
	of the skull is bone. Low frequencies, 1-2 MHz, reduce the attenuation
	of the ultrasound wave caused by bone. Transcranial Doppler also
	provides the advantage of acoustic windows representing specific
	points of the skull where the bone is thin enough to allow ultrasounds
	to penetrate. There are four acoustic windows: transtemporal, transorbital,
	suboccipital and retromandibular. The identification of each intracranial
	vessel is based on the following elements: (a) velocity and direction;
	(b) depth of signal capture; (c) possibility of following the vessel
	its whole length; (d) spatial relationship with other vessels; and
	(e) response to homolateral and contralateral carotid compression.
	The main fields of clinical application of transcranial Doppler are
	assessment of vasospasm, detection of stenosis of the intracranial
	arteries, evaluation of cerebrovascular autoregulation, non-invasive
	estimation of intracranial pressure, measure of effective downstream
	pressure and assessment of brain death. Mean flow velocity is directly
	proportional to flow and inversely proportional to the section of
	the vessel. Any circumstance that leads to a variation of one of
	these factors can thus affect mean velocity. The main pathological
	condition affecting flow velocity is the vasospasm. Vasospasm is
	a frequent complication of subarachnoid haemorrhage, it often remains
	clinically silent and the factors that make it symptomatic are largely
	unknown. Threshold velocities above which vasospasm comes into place
	are well defined as regards the median cerebral artery, while there
	is no consensus for the other vessels. Nevertheless, an increase
	in velocity alone is not sufficient to arrive at a diagnosis of vasospasm;
	a condition of hyperaemia also presents with an increase in flow
	velocity. The Lindegaard Index has therefore been introduced, which
	is defined by the ratio between the mean flow velocity in the median
	cerebral artery and the mean flow velocity in the internal carotid
	artery. Criteria for diagnosis of a stenosis >50\% of an intracranial
	vessel with transcranial Doppler include: (a) segmentary acceleration
	of flow velocity; (b) drop in velocity below the stenotic segment;
	(c) asymmetry; and (d) circumscribed flow disturbances (turbulence
	and musical murmur). The transcranial Doppler enables us to assess
	both components of self-regulation. The static component is measured
	by observing changes in flow velocity caused by pharmacologically
	induced episodes of hypertension and hypotension. The dynamic component
	of autoregulation can be measured using a method devised by Aaslid
	known as the 'cuff test'. A very effective and safe device for measuring
	cerebral autoregulation is the transient hyperaemic response test.
	This test is based on the compensatory vasodilatation of the arterioles,
	which occurs after brief compression of the common carotid. Csonyka
	proposed the following formula based on clinical observation for
	the calculation of cerebral perfusion pressure: CPP = MAP x FVd/FVm
	+ 14. Brain death is defined as the irreversible cessation of all
	functions of the whole brain. The clinical criteria are usually considered
	sufficient to establish a diagnosis of brain death; however, they
	might not be sufficient in patients who have been on sedatives or
	when there are ethical or legal controversies. Many authors have
	demonstrated the existence of a transcranial Doppler pattern, which
	is typical of brain death.},

	evidence of inaccurate stent deployment. Axial 2D views were used
	to measure diameters and cross-sectional areas and provide the basis
	for 3D reconstruction. These composited images produced single-frame
	views of entire vascular segments, with definition of vessel wall
	morphology, stent placement, and angioplasty-induced defects. This
	information was used in the decision to apply further treatment to
	the area in order to maximize luminal diameter and{sol}or correct
	defects. Conclusions: IVUS imaging is an important component of carotid
	artery stent procedures. It more accurately visualizes stent placement
	and vessel wall morphology than arteriography, information critical
	to the intraprocedural assessment process.},

  abstract = {Cardiac disease and stroke are the major causes of death in the Western
	World. Atherosclerosis of the carotid artery is the most important
	predictor of stroke. Elastography is a technique to assess the composition
	and vulnerability of an atherosclerotic plaque. Contrary to intravascular
	applications, the ultrasound beam and radial strain are not aligned
	in noninvasive acquisitions. In this study, 2D displacement and strain
	images were determined and used to calculate the radial and circumferential
	strain. Rf-data were acquired using a Philips SONOS 7500 live 3D
	ultrasound system, equipped with an 11_3L (3 to 11 MHz) linear array
	transducer and rf-interface. A homogeneous, hollow cylinder phantom
	[20\% gelatin, 1\% SiC scatterers (10 microM)] was measured in a
	water tank at different intraluminal pressures. In addition, measurements
	in patients (n = 12) were made to evaluate the in vivo applicability
	of the technique. Longitudinal and cross-sectional recordings were
	made, both in phantoms and patients. Strain along the ultrasound
	beam (axial strain) was determined using cross-correlation analysis
	for signal-windows from both the pre- and post-compression data.
	For lateral strain, new ultrasound lines were generated between the
	acquired lines using interpolation. A cross-correlation based search
	algorithm was applied to determine lateral displacement and strain.
	Longitudinal axial strain images in the phantom showed a decreasing
	strain from the lumen- vessel wall interface to the outer region
	that can be described by a 1 over r(2) relationship. The lateral
	strain image showed no strain in this direction indicating a plane
	strain situation. In the cross-sectional view, compression of the
	material in regions at 12 and 6 o'clock was observed, whereas expansion
	was observed in regions at 3 and 9 o'clock. This pattern is in accordance
	with theory, but can only be partly corrected for: in the transition
	regions, zero axial strain was measured. The lateral strain image
	showed a complementary pattern. In patients, low strain was observed
	in nonatherosclerotic artery walls. High and low strain regions were
	found in atherosclerotic plaques. High quality elastograms were generated
	both in longitudinal and cross-sectional views. In conclusion, 2D
	noninvasive elastography of atherosclerotic carotid plaques is feasible.
	Phantom studies revealed elastograms in accordance with theory. Additional
	in vivo validation is needed to assess the value of this technique
	for identifying plaque vulnerability and composition.},

	: Studies reporting prevalences of MES and the risk of cerebral ischemic

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major thrombotic and embolic complications of atherosclerosis
	are closely associated with irregularity and rupture of atheromatous
	plaques in both the carotid and coronary arteries. Plaque instability
	is partly determined by local factors, but systemic factors, such
	as infection, autoimmunity, or genes, may also be important. If plaque
	stability is influenced by systemic factors that are present in only
	a proportion of patients, some individuals should be more prone to
	rupture of plaques than others--ie, irregular plaques should occur
	in multiple vascular beds in some individuals more frequently than
	would be expected by chance alone. METHODS: We studied 5393 carotid
	bifurcation angiograms from 3007 patients with a recently symptomatic
	carotid stenosis. We assessed the extent to which plaque-surface
	irregularity at the symptomatic carotid artery was associated with
	irregularity at a distant site, the contralateral carotid artery,
	and the extent to which plaque irregularity at these sites was associated
	with previous myocardial infarction or subsequent non-stroke vascular
	death (due mainly to coronary-artery disease). FINDINGS: Patients
	with plaque-surface irregularity (n=1897) in the symptomatic carotid
	artery were more likely than those with smooth plaque (n=110) to
	have irregularity in the contralateral carotid artery (odds ratio
	2.21 [95\% CI 1.62-3.01], p<0.001). Patients with irregular plaques
	in both arteries were more likely to have had a previous myocardial
	infarction than patients with smooth plaques (hazard ratio 1.82 [1.23-2.64],
	p<0.001), and were more likely to have a non-stroke vascular death
	on follow-up (hazard ratio 1.67 [1.15-2.44], p=0.007). However, there
	was no difference in the risk of non-vascular death (hazard ratio
	0.92 [0.57-1.45], p=0.5). These associations were not explicable
	on the basis of differences in traditional vascular risk factors.
	INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that some individuals have a systemic
	predisposition to irregularity and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques
	that is independent of traditional vascular risk factors. This finding
	supports the hypothesis that other systemic factors are important
	in the cause of plaque instability.},

	ipsilateral ischaemic stroke, and is the treatment of choice, in
	patients with recently symptomatic 70-99\% carotid stenosis. However,
	the 3-year risk of stroke on medical treatment alone is only about
	20\%. We investigated whether the efficacy of endarterectomy would
	be improved if patients with a high risk of stroke on medical treatment
	and a low risk of operative stroke or death could be identified.
	METHODS: We developed two prognostic models from data on patients
	with 0-69\% carotid stenosis in the European Carotid Surgery Trial
	(ECST). The medical model predicted risk of ipsilateral carotid territory
	major ischaemic stroke (fatal or lasting longer than 7 days) on medical
	treatment and the surgical model predicted risk of major stroke and
	death within 30 days of endarterectomy. From these models we developed
	a prognostic score to identify patients with a high risk of stroke
	on medical treatment but a low operative risk. We validated the models
	and tested the scoring system on 990 ECST patients with 70-99\% carotid
	stenosis assigned surgery (594) or medical treatment only (396).
	FINDINGS: When patients with 70-99\% stenosis were stratified by
	the scoring system, which was based on seven independent prognostic
	factors, endarterectomy was beneficial in only 162 (16\%) patients.
	The 5-year absolute risk of carotid territory ipsilateral major ischaemic
	stroke, operative major stroke, or death was lowered by 33\% in the
	16\% of patients with a score of 4 or more (odds ratio 0.12 [95\%
	CI 0.05-0.29], p<0.0001), but not in the other 828 (84\%) patients
	(1.00 [0.65-1.54], p=0.7). INTERPRETATION: Many patients with recently
	symptomatic 70-99\% carotid stenosis may not benefit from carotid
	endarterectomy. Validation of the predictive score is needed on external
	datasets, but risk-factor modelling could be useful to identify those

	As a means to prevent cerebrovascular events, current concepts advocate
	endarterectomy or carotid stenting in patients with advanced carotid
	disease. Arterial stenosis alone has been shown to be a poor predictor
	of cardiovascular events and therefore both arterial stenosis and
	patient symptom status are taken as indications for interventional
	therapy. Several studies have shown that symptomatic subjects benefit
	more from a carotid endarterectomy than asymptomatic subjects: 3-6
	carotid endarterectomies are needed to prevent one stroke per year
	in symptomatic subjects with > 70 \% stenosis compared to 14 - 17
	carotid endarterectomies in asymptomatic patients with > 50 \% stenosis.
	It is commonly accepted today that factors other than the degree
	of luminal stenosis can determine a patient's symptom status, such
	as the composition or the superficial structure of atherosclerotic
	plaque. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging has overcome the

	plaque. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role and the
	diagnostic efficacy of multidetector row CT angiography (MDCTA) and
	ultrasound (US) echo color Doppler (US-ECD) in the study of patients
	with carotid plaque complicated by ulceration through the comparison
	with the surgical observation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January
	2004 to October 2005, 237 patients, for a total of 474 carotid arteries,
	studied at first with color Doppler US, were analyzed using CT angiography.
	A total of 103 patients underwent a carotid endarterectomy. We analyzed
	stenosis degree, plaque composition, and presence of ulcerations.
	In a second phase, the data were compared with the surgical results
	when the MDCTA indicated surgical intervention. RESULTS: MDCTA found
	31 ulcerations; the surgical confirmation underlined a 93.75\% sensitivity
	and a 98.59\% specificity. US-ECD performances were 37.5\% and 91.5\%
	for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The number of patients
	who showed plaque ulcerations increased with the severity of stenosis.
	Furthermore, ulcerations of the carotid plaque occurred more often
	proximal than distal to the point of maximum stenosis, and this trend
	increased with the severity of the stenosis. We also determined that
	fatty plaques were more likely to be affected by ulcerations. CONCLUSIONS:
	The results of our study suggest that MDCTA detects with higher sensitivity
	and specificity the presence of ulcerated plaque compared with US-ECD,
	which has been demonstrated to be less effective in this evaluation.
	Considering the high MDCTA sensitivity and specificity for detection
	of plaque ulceration, we therefore recommend MDCTA as a useful step
	for correct presurgical planning.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Stroke is a leading cause of severe disability in the western

	in order to rapidly plan the most efficient therapy. The purpose
	of this work was to evaluate the agreement between ultrasound echo-color
	Doppler (US-ECD) and multidetector-row CT angiography (MDCTA) in
	determining the degree of carotid stenosis. Methods and Materials:
	From January 2004 to February 2007, 187 patients who had previously
	undergone both US-ECD and MDCTA were studied retrospectively. For
	each patient, stenosis degree was measured by applying the North
	American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria. Data
	derived from MDCTA and US-ECD were then compared to calculate the
	inter-technique variability by using Cohen kappa statistics. For
	all plaque types (fatty, mixed and calcified), inter-technique variability
	was assessed. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to highlight
	differences between the procedures, and scatterplots were also calculated.
	As a gold standard, reference surgical comparisons were performed
	in 50 patients. Results: The percentage of observed agreements in
	the evaluation of stenosis degree was 72.19\% with a kappa value
	of 0.659 (95\% confidence interval: 0.604-0.715) and a weighted kappa
	of 0.789. After the evaluating stenosis degree in fatty, mixed and
	calcified plaques, the percentages of observed agreements were 79.31,
	74.58 and 64.29\%, respectively, with kappa values of 0.738, 0.691
	and 0.565. Conclusion: A good agreement between US-ECD and MDCTA
	in the evaluation of stenosis degree was observed, together with
	a remarkable difference between the 2 techniques in the assessment
	both of calcified plaques and of plaques showing a predominant calcific

	However, the predictive value of intravascular elastography to detect

	coronary arteries were investigated with intravascular elastography
	and subsequently processed for histology. In histology, a vulnerable
	plaque was defined as a plaque consisting of a thin cap (<250 \&mu;m)
	with moderate to heavy macrophage infiltration and at least 40\%
	of atheroma. In elastography, a vulnerable plaque was defined as
	a plaque with a high strain region at the surface with adjacent low
	strain regions. In 24 diseased coronary arteries, we studied 54 cross
	sections. In histology, 26 vulnerable plaques and 28 nonvulnerable
	plaques were found. Receiver operator characteristic analysis revealed
	a maximum predictive power for a strain value threshold of 1.26\%.
	The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.85.
	The sensitivity was 88\%, and the specificity was 89\% to detect

	the main cause of acute coronary events. At present it is not known

	depends more on plaque composition and vulnerability (plaque type)
	than on the degree of stenosis (plaque size). Lipid accumulation
	and chronic inflammation, particularly macrophage activities, seem
	to influence the development and the stability of a plaque and thus
	its propensity to rupture. Macrophages have the ability to secrete
	proteolytic enzymes and often infiltrate the region of imminent plaque
	rupture, and disruption may be associated with a generalized inflammatory
	reaction. Further, plaque disruption tends to occur at points where
	the plaque surface is weakest, corresponding to locations where mechanical
	and hemodynamic forces have their highest impact. The risk of plaque
	disruption is a function of both plaque vulnerability (intrinsic
	disease) and rupture triggers (extrinsic forces). The former predisposes
	the plaque to rupture; the latter may precipitate rupture. The danger
	of vulnerable plaques, however, is not related to disruption as such
	but to the resulting thrombosis. The magnitude of this thrombotic
	response and the ensuing flow obstruction depends on the contents
	and quantity of exposed thrombogenic plaque material, the degree
	of pre-existing stenosis, and the systemic thrombotic tendency. The
	thrombotic response is a dynamic process that is decisive for the

	syndromes and stroke. Therefore, the ability to detect thrombus in
	vivo has a significant clinical implication. Magnetic resonance imaging
	(MRI) has shown promise in noninvasive thrombus detection. However,
	thrombus characterization and age definition remain difficult. We
	sought to evaluate the use of a fibrin-targeted peptide (EP-2104R)
	for MR thrombus detection and to compare this modality with non-contrast-enhanced
	(NCE) MRI and with Gd-DTPA injection at various ages and time points
	after thrombus generation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Carotid artery thrombosis
	was induced by external injury and stasis in 18 rabbits. T1-weighted
	MRI was performed before and after contrast agent injection, within
	6 hours of thrombus induction, at 48 hours, at 1 week, and every
	week up to 8 weeks after injury. Correlation with histopathology
	was performed. The fibrin-targeted contrast agent accurately detected
	all thrombi, regardless of their size, location, and age. Although
	thrombus signal intensity after injection decreased with thrombus
	age (P<0.001), enhancement at 8 weeks was still present. Gd-DTPA
	injection was not associated with an improvement of thrombus detection.
	EP-2104R was superior to both NCE and Gd-DTPA injection (P<0.001).
	Histopathologic examination showed thrombus organization over time.
	Fibrin was gradually replaced by fibrous tissue. A strong correlation
	was found between thrombus enhancement and collagen content of the
	organizing thrombus with time (R=-0.89; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In
	an experimental animal model of carotid thrombosis, we have demonstrated
	the superiority of a fibrin-targeted MR contrast agent for in vivo
	detection of chronic or organized thrombus, compared with NCE MRI

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The value of carotid endarterectomy (CEA)
	depends on the safety of the operation. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound
	(TCD) was used to evaluate the possibilities of hypoperfusion, hyperperfusion,
	and embolization as causes of stroke and to evaluate the significance
	of Doppler microembolic signals (DMES). METHODS: Five hundred CEAs
	were monitored with TCD of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery
	during various phases of CEA to determine hemodynamic changes and
	incidence of DMES. Complications were graded according to their severity,
	and their probable cause was determined from TCD criteria and review
	of hospital charts. RESULTS: We observed 24 cerebrovascular complications
	(4.8\%), including 9 with transient ischemic attacks and 15 (3\%)
	with permanent deficits. Among all cerebrovascular complications,
	embolism was judged to be responsible in 13 (54\%; P < .02 compared
	with hypoperfusion), hyperperfusion in 7 (29\%; P < .14 compared
	with hypoperfusion), and hypoperfusion in 4 (17\%; P < .08 compared
	with embolism plus hyperperfusion). The surgeons responded to TCD
	information by several strategies depending on the TCD information.
	The incidence of permanent deficits diminished from 7\% in the first
	100 operations to 2\% in the last 400 (P < or = .01). Shunting was
	more strongly associated with cerebrovascular complications than
	nonshunting, but this difference was not significant (P = .24). Intraoperative
	prevalence of DMES was strongly associated with cerebrovascular complications
	(P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Embolism is the principal cause of cerebrovascular
	complications from CEA; hyperperfusion and hypoperfusion are also
	important causes. TCD provides information that allows prompt identification
	and treatment of these three major causes of stroke from this operation.
	The perioperative stroke rate can be reduced by appropriate measures,
	taken by the surgeons, based on findings of TCD monitoring.},

	quantitatively patterns of arterial wall motion with different techniques.
	Temporal sequences of digitized B-mode ultrasound images of the carotid
	arteries of 10 young healthy subjects were interrogated. Arterial
	wall motion was analyzed using: a/ block-matching, and b/ optical
	flow. The motion of selected regions of the luminal surface of the

	The motion of areas of the arterial wall was estimated using optical
	flow. Waveforms showing radial and axial displacements, as well as
	radial and axial velocities were produced for the selected ROIs using
	both techniques. Both techniques produced waveforms with peaks, corresponding
	to cardiac cycle events, that occurred at similar time points. To
	study the similarity of the waveforms obtained from the two techniques,
	a cross-correlation coefficient was calculated. Cross-correlation
	coefficients were 0.72..0.22 and 0.70..0.19 for displacements and
	velocities, respectively, in the radial direction. In the axial direction,

	Normal arteries contained little or no cathepsin K or S. In contrast,

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine whether a stratified gray-scale
	median (GSM) analysis of the carotid plaque combined with color mapping
	could predict plaque histology better than an overall GSM measurement.
	METHODS: Thirty-one carotid plaques derived from 28 patients undergoing
	carotid endarterectomy were investigated by ultrasound. GSMs of the
	whole plaque were used as measurement of echogenicity. A profile
	of the regional GSM as a function of distance from the plaque surface
	could be generated. Plaque pixels were further mapped into 3 different
	colors depending on their GSM value. RESULTS: Plaques with large
	calcifications presented the highest GSM values, and those with large
	hemorrhagic areas or with a predominant necrotic core exhibited the
	lowest. Fibrous plaques had intermediate GSM values. A necrotic core
	located in a juxtalumenal position was associated with significantly
	lower GSM values (P=0.009) and with a predominant red color (GSM
	<50) at the surface (P=0.0019). With respect to the thickness of
	the fibrous cap and the position of the necrotic core, the sensitivity
	and specificity of the predominant red color of the whole plaque
	was respectively 45\% and 67\% and 53\% and 75\%; considering the
	predominant red color of the surface, the sensitivity and specificity
	increased to 73\% and 67\% and 84\% and 75\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
	The stratified GSM measurement combined with color mapping showed
	a good correlation with the different histopathological components
	and further allowed identification with good accuracy of determinants
	of plaque instability. This approach should be investigated in a
	prospective, natural history study.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Given the importance of inflammation in atherosclerosis,
	we sought to determine if atherosclerotic plaque inflammation could
	be measured noninvasively in humans using positron emission tomography
	(PET). BACKGROUND: Earlier PET studies using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
	demonstrated increased FDG uptake in atherosclerotic plaques. Here
	we tested the ability of FDG-PET to measure carotid plaque inflammation
	in patients who subsequently underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
	METHODS: Seventeen patients with severe carotid stenoses underwent
	FDG-PET imaging 3 h after FDG administration (13 to 25 mCi), after
	which carotid plaque FDG uptake was determined as the ratio of plaque
	to blood activity (target to background ratio, TBR). Less than 1
	month after imaging, subjects underwent CEA, after which carotid
	specimens were processed to identify macrophages (staining with anti-CD68
	antibodies). RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between
	the PET signal from the carotid plaques and the macrophage staining
	from the corresponding histologic sections (r = 0.70; p < 0.0001).
	When mean FDG uptake (mean TBR) was compared with mean inflammation
	(mean percentage CD68 staining) for each of the 17 patients, the
	correlation was even stronger (r = 0.85; p < 0.0001). Fluorodeoxyglucose
	uptake did not correlate with plaque area, plaque thickness, or area
	of smooth muscle cell staining. CONCLUSIONS: We established that
	FDG-PET imaging can be used to assess the severity of inflammation
	in carotid plaques in patients. If subsequent natural history studies
	link increased FDG-PET activity in carotid arteries with clinical
	events, this noninvasive measure could be used to identify a subset
	of patients with carotid atherosclerosis in need of intensified medical
	therapy or carotid artery intervention to prevent stroke.},

  abstract = {Invasive procedures to revascularize occluded blood vessels rely on
	the mechanical response of the diseased tissue. Failure rates associated
	with such procedures show the need for improvement. to understand
	the associated mechanics, the material properties of atherosclerotic
	plaque should be known; yet data are scant. The purpose of this study
	was to investigate the different mechanical responses exhibited by
	plaques with different compositions, focusing specifically on radial
	compressive behavior. A custom-built experimental system was developed
	that was fully computer controlled with a broad range of loading
	capabilities. A temperature-controlled, physiologic specimen bath
	allowed testing at 37 degrees C. Monotonically loaded specimens showed
	that plaque behavior was nonlinear under finite deformations. A multiple
	cycle protocol, executed in two phases, distinguished three types
	of mechanical response of different plaques. The differences in behavior
	were associated with histologic differences in plaque composition,
	and mechanically characterized by different ''repeatability'' (the
	stabilization of the cyclic response) and ''recoverability'' (the
	second loading phase retracing the first loading phase behavior).
	Type 1 behavior was categorized by repeatability and recoverability
	. Type 2 behavior displayed repeatability but only partial recovery
	during the second loading phase. Recovery was absent in type 3 behavior.
	The histologic observations demonstrated that calcified tissue was
	present only in specimens displaying type 1 behavior. Fibrous tissue
	and part of a modified media (due to disease) were present in specimens
	displaying type 2 behavior. An atheroma, along with a relatively
	thin modified media, was present in specimens displaying type 3 behavior.
	The differences in the maximum stretches attained at the end of phase
	I loading, the stretch offset from the first to the 15th cycle of
	phase I loading, and the hysteresis in the first and 15th cycles
	of phase I loading distinguished the specimen behaviors with statistical
	significance. These compression data showed that plaques exhibit
	composition- and history-dependent nonlinear and inelastic responses
	under finite deformations. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	following rupture of vulnerable plaques. Biomechanical stresses within
	this plaque may increase vulnerability to rupture. In this report
	the authors describe the use of in vivo carotid plaque imaging and
	computational mechanics to document the magnitude and distribution
	of intrinsic plaque stresses. METHODS: Ten (five symptomatic and
	five asymptomatic) individuals underwent plaque characterization
	magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Plaque geometry and composition
	were determined by multisequence review. Intrinsic plaque stress
	profiles were generated from 3D meshes by using finite element computational
	analysis. Differences in principal (shear) stress between normal
	and diseased sections of the carotid artery and between symptomatic
	and asymptomatic plaques were noted. RESULTS: There was a significant
	difference in peak principal stress between diseased and nondiseased
	segments of the artery (mean difference 537.65 kPa, p < 0.05). Symptomatic
	plaques had higher mean stresses than asymptomatic plaques (627.6
	kPa compared with 370.2 kPa, p = 0.05), which were independent of
	luminal stenosis and plaque composition. CONCLUSION: Significant
	differences in plaque stress exist between plaques from symptomatic
	individuals and those from asymptomatic individuals. The MR imaging-based
	computational analysis may therefore be a useful aid to identification
	of vulnerable plaques in vivo.},

	METHODS: Twenty participants (mean age, 69.8 years [standard deviation]
	+/- 10.5; 75\% men) with 16\%-79\% carotid stenosis at duplex ultrasonography
	were imaged with 1.5-T and 3.0-T MR imaging units with bilateral
	four-element phased-array surface coils. This HIPAA-compliant study
	was approved by the institutional review board, and all participants
	gave written informed consent. Protocols designed for similar signal-to-noise
	ratios across platforms were implemented to acquire axial T1-weighted,
	T2-weighted, intermediate-weighted, time-of-flight, and contrast
	material-enhanced T1-weighted images. Lumen area, wall area, total
	vessel area, wall thickness, and presence or absence and area of
	plaque components were documented. Continuous variables from different
	field strengths were compared by using the intraclass correlation
	coefficient (ICC) and repeated measures analysis. The Cohen kappa
	was used to evaluate agreement between 1.5 T and 3.0 T on compositional
	dichotomous variables. RESULTS: There was a strong level of agreement
	between field strengths for all morphologic variables, with ICCs
	ranging from 0.88 to 0.96. Agreement in the identification of presence
	or absence of plaque components was very good for calcification (kappa
	= 0.72), lipid-rich necrotic core (kappa = 0.73), and hemorrhage
	(kappa = 0.66). However, the visualization of hemorrhage was greater
	at 1.5 T than at 3.0 T (14.7\% vs 7.8\%, P < .001). Calcifications
	measured significantly (P = .03) larger at 3.0 T, while lipid-rich
	necrotic cores without hemorrhage were similar between field strengths
	(P = .9). CONCLUSION: At higher field strengths, the increased susceptibility
	of calcification and paramagnetic ferric iron in hemorrhage may alter
	quantification and/or detection. Nevertheless, imaging criteria at
	1.5 T for carotid vessel wall interpretation are applicable at 3.0
	T.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The ultrasonic image can offer unique information
	on the composition of atherosclerotic plaque, ie, the relative content
	of lipids, fibrous tissue, and calcific deposits. To date, however,
	the echographic assessment of plaque structure is based on a subjective,
	qualitative evaluation of the bidimensional images. We evaluated
	the feasibility and accuracy of assessing, in vivo, the acoustic
	properties of arterial carotid plaques by means of a suitably modified
	echographic apparatus allowing direct access to the radiofrequency
	signal. METHODS: In 15 patients undergoing carotid thromboendarterectomy,
	the ultrasonic findings in 70 discrete sites (within the plaque,
	n = 54; normal sites, n = 11; or intraluminal thrombi, n = 5) were
	correlated with the histological analysis (hematoxylin-eosin and
	Mallory trichrome stains) independently performed on the arterial
	samples. The pathological examination was carried out at a similar
	level of the insonation; the sites analyzed within the plaque were
	chosen because of their uniform echoic characteristics. In each ultrasonic
	region of interest selected from the echographic image, the integrated
	amplitude of the rectified radiofrequency signal was measured as
	the integrated backscatter index. RESULTS: The intimal-medial layer
	of normal carotid wall (n = 11) exhibited values of -32.5 +/- 9.4
	dB. The integrated backscatter index in fatty sites (n = 11, -40.3
	+/- 5.4 dB) differed from that of fibrous (n = 12, -23.8 +/- 5.0
	dB) and calcified (n = 26, -11.5 +/- 5.2 dB, P < .01 for all intergroup
	differences) sites. Intraluminal thrombotic sites (n = 5, -42 +/-
	5.1 dB, P < .01) differed from fibrous and calcified subsets (P <
	.01) but overlapped (P = NS) with fatty sites. Histological sampling
	also showed two sites of intraplaque hemorrhage that exhibited very
	low backscatter values (-53 and -58 dB) and three fibrofatty sites
	showing backscatter values (-28, -28, and -32 dB) intermediate between
	the fibrous and the fatty subsets. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative analysis
	of integrated backscatter of the arterial wall is feasible in humans
	and provides an operator-independent assessment of plaque echoic
	structure. In particular, integrated backscatter is effective in
	distinguishing lipidic, fibrotic, and calcific components in human
	atherosclerotic plaques.},

  journal = {J Vasc Surg},
  year = {2008},
  month = {Sep},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that plaque vulnerability,
	rather than the degree of stenosis, is important in predicting the
	occurrence of subsequent cerebral ischemic events in patients with
	carotid artery stenosis. The many imaging modalities currently available
	have different properties with regard to the visualization of the
	extent of vulnerability in carotid plaque formation. METHODS: Original
	published studies were identified using the MEDLINE database (January
	1966 to March 2008). Manual cross-referencing was also performed.
	RESULTS: There is no single imaging modality that can produce definitive
	information about the state of vulnerability of an atherosclerotic
	plaque. Each has its own specific drawbacks, which may be the use
	of ionizing radiation or nephrotoxic contrast agents, an invasive
	character, low patient tolerability, or simply the paucity of information
	obtained on plaque vulnerability. Functional molecular imaging techniques
	such as positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission-computed
	tomography (SPECT) and near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) do seem
	able accurately to visualize and even quantify features of plaque
	vulnerability and its pathophysiologic processes. Promising new techniques
	like near infra-red fluorescence imaging are being developed and
	may be beneficial in this field. CONCLUSION: There is a promising
	role for functional molecular imaging modalities like PET, SPECT,
	or NIRS related to improvement of selection criteria for carotid
	intervention, especially when combined with CT or MRI to add further
	anatomical details to molecular information. Further information
	will be needed to define whether and where this functional molecular
	imaging will fit into a clinical strategy.},

	(IBS) in the atherosclerotic lesion was compared with histological
	findings of the respective tissue in 35 patients with carotid artery

	by locating the region-of-interest (ROI) in the center of the atherosclerotic
	lesion and calibrating by subtracting the IBS in the tunica externa
	of the vessel from the IBS of the ROI. IBS was also determined at
	the interface of the plaque, and at this site it was analyzed in
	relation to the thickness of the fibrous cap. Lipid content, fibrous
	tissue, thrombus, hemorrhage and calcification were histologically
	assessed in the respective tissue. Carotid IBS in the lipid lesion

	secondary stroke prevention. Non-invasive imaging, now widely available,
	is replacing intra-arterial angiography for carotid stenosis, but
	the accuracy remains uncertain despite an extensive literature. We
	systematically reviewed the accuracy of non-invasive imaging compared
	with intra-arterial angiography for diagnosing carotid stenosis in
	patients with carotid territory ischaemic symptoms.Methods We searched
	for articles published between 1980 and April 2004; included studies
	comparing non-invasive imaging with intra-arterial angiography that
	met Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) criteria;
	extracted data to calculate sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive
	imaging, to test for heterogeneity and to perform sensitivity analyses;
	and categorised percent stenosis by the North American Symptomatic
	Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) method.Results In 41 included
	studies (2541 patients, 4876 arteries), contrast-enhanced MR angiography
	was more sensitive (0·94, 95\% CI 0·88-0·97) and specific (0·93,
	95\% CI 0·89-0·96) for 70-99\% stenosis than Doppler ultrasound,
	MR angiography, and CT angiography (sensitivities 0·89, 0·88, 0·76;
	specificities 0·84, 0·84, 0·94, respectively). Data for 50-69\% stenoses
	and combinations of non-invasive tests were sparse and unreliable.
	There was heterogeneity between studies and evidence of publication
	bias.Interpretation Non-invasive tests, used cautiously, could replace
	intra-arterial carotid angiography for 70-99\% stenosis. However,
	more data are required to determine their accuracy, especially at
	50-69\% stenoses where the balance of risk and benefit for carotid
	endarterectomy is particularly narrow, and to explore and overcome
	heterogeneity. Methodology for evaluating imaging tests should be
	improved; blinded, prospective studies in clinically relevant patients
	are essential basic characteristics.},

  abstract = {Plaque formation begins with the transportation of lipoproteins into
	the arterial wall. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) carries most of
	the cholesterol in human plasma and becomes trapped within the subendothelial
	space of the wall. First, the lipid component of LDL is oxidized,
	and this process attracts monocytes to enter the wall and become
	macrophages, which further the oxidative process [1]. High-density
	lipoprotein (HDL) has been shown to inhibit this oxidative process
	[2], thereby providing protection against atherogenesis. Macrophages
	also modify the surface protein of LDL, apoprotein B, making it unrecognizable
	by the LDL receptor and leading to dysregulation with resultant massive
	accumulation of cholesterol [1]. Smooth muscle cells begin to migrate
	into the lesion, stimulated by growth factors released by macrophages,
	platelets (which may have thrombosed beneath an area of endothelial
	injury), endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells [3]. This inflammatory
	process results in modified LDL that is taken up by macrophages or
	smooth muscle cells, leading to the formation of foam cells. The
	accumulation of foam cells and intercellular lipid in the intimal
	layer constitutes the first stage of atherosclerosis called the fatty
	streak. Many have considered the fatty streak to be the precursor
	of fibrous plaque formation; however, some lesions may not develop
	further [4]. Virmani et al [5] classify the fatty streak as intimal
	xanthomata, which refers to focal accumulations of fat-laden macrophages
	within the intima. We know that most intimal xanthomata will regress
	because the distribution of lesions in the third decade of life and
	beyond is very different from the fatty streaks seen in children
	[5]. Fibrous plaque is formed when smooth muscle cells produce a
	fibrous cap around the lipid core. The lipid core consists of an
	extracellular mass of cholesterol esters, and is lined by foam cells.
	The cholesterol esters accumulate as the foam cells consume more
	and more lipid, and eventually become necrotic and break apart, partly

	with integrated backscatter (IBS) analysis. BACKGROUND Atherosclerotic
	plaque stabilization is a promising clinical strategy to prevent
	cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).
	There is a correlation between coronary and carotid plaque instability,
	and echolucent plaques are recognized as vulnerable plaques. METHODS
	Consecutive nonhypercholesterolemic patients with CAD were randomly
	assigned Adult Treatment Panel-III diet therapy (diet group; n =
	30) or pravastatin (statin group; n = 30). Echolucent carotid plaques
	were monitored by measuring intima-media thickness (IMT) and echogenicity
	by IBS for six months. RESULTS Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein
	cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were
	significantly decreased in the statin group (from 197 +/- 15 mg/dl
	to 170 +/- 18 mg/dl [p < 0.001]; from 131 +/- 14 mg/dl to 99 +/-
	14 mg/dl [p < 0.001]; and from 0.11 [0.04 to 0.22] mg/dl to 0.06
	[0.04 to 0.11] mg/dl [p < 0.05]; respectively), whereas only total
	cholesterol was moderately reduced (from 193 +/- 24 mg/dl to 185
	+/- 22 mg/dl [p < 0.05]) and LDL-C and triglycerides insignificantly
	reduced in the diet group. Significant increases of echogenicity
	of carotid plaques were noted in the statin group but not in the
	diet group (from -18.5 +/- 4.1 dB to -15.9 +/- 3.7 dB [p < 0.001]
	and from -18.2 +/- 4.0 dB to -18.9 +/- 3.5 dB [p = 0.13]; respectively)
	without significant regression of plaque-IMT values in both groups.
	CONCLUSIONS Statin therapy is rapidly effective in increasing echogenicity
	of vulnerable plaques without regression of plaque size in nonhypercholesterolemic
	patients with CAD. Quantitative assessment of carotid plaque quality
	by ultrasound with IBS is clinically useful for monitoring atherosclerotic
	lesions by evaluating vulnerability of atheroma.},

	Consequently, different investigators using different measurement

	for calcaneal SOS, impairing and often precluding meaningful comparison
	and/or pooling of measurements. A numerical method has been developed
	to model the effects of frequency-dependent attenuation and dispersion
	on transit-time-based SOS estimates. The numerical technique is based
	on a previously developed linear system analytic model for Gaussian
	pulses propagating through linearly attenuating, weakly dispersive
	media. The numerical approach is somewhat more general in that it
	can be used to predict the effects of arbitrary pulse shapes and
	dispersion relationships. The numerical technique, however, utilizes
	several additional assumptions (compared with the analytic model)
	which would be required for the practical task of correcting existing
	clinical databases. These include a single dispersion relationship
	for all calcaneus samples, a simple linear model relating phase velocity
	to broadband ultrasonic attenuation, and a constant calcaneal thickness.
	Measurements on a polycarbonate plate and 30 human calcaneus samples
	were in good quantitative agreement with numerical predictions. In
	addition, the numerical approach predicts that in cancellous bone,
	frequency-dependent attenuation tends to be a greater contributor
	to variations ire transit-time-based SOS estimates than dispersion.
	This approach may be used to adjust previously acquired individual
	measurements so that SOS data recorded with different devices using

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: As are the attenuation coefficient and sound speed, the
	backscatter coefficient is a fundamental ultrasonic property that
	has been used to characterize many tissues. Unfortunately, there
	is currently far less standardization for the ultrasonic backscatter
	measurement than for the other two, as evidenced by a previous American
	Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM)-sponsored interlaboratory
	comparison of ultrasonic backscatter, attenuation, and speed measurements
	(J Ultrasound Med 1999; 18:615-631). To explore reasons for these
	disparities, the AIUM Endowment for Education and Research recently
	supported this second interlaboratory comparison, which extends the
	upper limit of the frequency range from 7 to 9 MHz. METHODS: Eleven
	laboratories were provided with standard test objects designed and
	manufactured at the University of Wisconsin (Madison, WI). Each laboratory
	was asked to perform ultrasonic measurements of sound speed, attenuation
	coefficients, and backscatter coefficients. Each laboratory was blinded
	to the values of the ultrasonic properties of the test objects at
	the time the measurements were performed. RESULTS: Eight of the 11
	laboratories submitted results. The range of variation of absolute
	magnitude of backscatter coefficient measurements was about 2 orders
	of magnitude. If the results of 1 outlier laboratory are excluded,
	then the range is reduced to about 1 order of magnitude. Agreement
	regarding frequency dependence of backscatter was better than reported
	in the previous interlaboratory comparison. For example, when scatterers
	were small compared with the ultrasonic wavelength, experimental
	frequency-dependent backscatter coefficient data obtained by the
	participating laboratories were usually consistent with the expected
	Rayleigh scattering behavior (proportional to frequency to the fourth
	power). CONCLUSIONS: Greater standardization of backscatter measurement
	methods is needed. Measurements of frequency dependence of backscatter
	are more consistent than measurements of absolute magnitude.},

	multilevel block matching (MLBM) algorithm uses variable matching
	block and search window sizes in a coarse-to-fine scheme, preserving
	the relative immunity to noise associated with the use of a large
	matching block while preserving the motion field detail associated
	with the use of a small matching block. To decrease further the sensitivity
	of the multilevel approach to noise, speckle decorrelation and false
	matches, a smooth motion model-based block matching (SMBM) algorithm
	has been implemented that takes into account the spatial inertia
	of soft tissue elements. The new algorithms were compared to SLBM
	through a series of experiments involving manual translation of soft
	tissue phantoms, motion field computer simulations of rotation, compression
	and shear deformation, and an experiment involving contraction of
	human forearm muscles. Measures of tracking accuracy included mean
	squared tracking error, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and blinded
	observations of optical flow. Measures of tracking efficiency included
	the number of sum squared difference calculations and the computation
	time. In the phantom translation experiments, the SMBM algorithm
	successfully matched the accuracy of SLBM using both large and small
	matching blocks while significantly reducing the number of computations
	and computation time when a large matching block was used. For the
	computer simulations, SMBM yielded better tracking accuracies and
	spatial resolution when compared with SLBM using a large matching
	block. For the muscle experiment, SMBM outperformed SLBM both in

  abstract = {Numerous epidemiologic observations reporting high prevalence of migraine
	among young individuals with stroke as well as dysfunction of cerebral
	arteries during migraine attacks prompt speculation on the existence
	of a comorbidity between the two disorders. The recent finding of
	silent infarct-like brain lesions in migraineurs reinforced this
	hypothesis and raised questions on whether migraine may be a progressive
	disorder rather than simply an episodic disorder. Stroke can occur
	during the course of migraine attacks with aura, supporting the assumption
	of a causal relation between the two diseases. Migraine may accentuate
	other existing risk factors for stroke, and both jointly increase
	the risk of cerebral ischemia outside of migraine attacks. In this
	regard, the role of migraine might be that of predisposing condition
	for cerebral ischemia. Migraine and ischemic stroke may be the end
	phenotype of common pathogenic mechanisms. Evidence of a migraine-stroke
	relation in cases of specific disorders, such as CADASIL (cerebral
	autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy)
	and MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis,
	and stroke-like episodes), strongly supports this concept. Finally,
	acute focal cerebral ischemia can trigger migraine attacks, and,
	thus, migraine may be the consequence of stroke. In this paper, we
	will review contemporary epidemiologic studies, discuss potential
	mechanisms of migraine-induced stroke and comorbid ischemic stroke,

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Echolucent carotid plaques, as well as downstream
	micro-embolisation, may be associated with an increased risk of stroke.
	However, the relationship between carotid plaque ultrasound characteristics
	and micro-embolic signals (MES) detected in the middle cerebral artery
	(MCA) is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate
	the prevalence of MES in patients with symptomatic high-grade internal
	carotid artery (ICA) stenosis and to identify predisposing factors,
	such as plaque echogenicity and intra stenotic blood flow velocity
	pattern. METHODS: 197 patients (mean age 69.5+/-8.6, 161 males) with
	confirmed symptomatic high-grade ICA stenosis and anti-platelet treatment
	underwent bilateral MES monitoring for 30 minutes within the anterior
	circulation, using Power M-mode transcranial Doppler techniques (TCD).
	Carotid artery plaques were characterized by Gray-Weale scaling.
	RESULTS: In 32.0\% of the patients, we detected MES by TCD within
	the MCA on the symptomatic side, but the same finding was made in
	only 4.5\% on the corresponding asymptomatic site (p<0.0001). The
	presence or absence of MES was associated with neither ultrasonic
	plaque characteristics nor the intrastenotic blood flow velocities
	at peak systole and end diastole. The median time since the last
	ischemic event symptoms was shorter in the patient group with MES
	[+] than in MES [-] (p=0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Despite optimum standard
	anti-platelet therapy, cerebral micro-embolisation occurs in 30\%
	of patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease, which might
	therefore be a possible risk factor for recurrent neurological symptoms.
	However, the presence of MES is independent of intrastenotic blood
	flow disturbances and grey scale ultrasound plaque characteristics.
	The presence of MES as an indicator of unstable plaque and thereby
	a possible risk factor for stroke should be evaluated prospectively
	using various algorithms for plaque classifications.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE--To determine whether the addition of carotid endarterectomy
	to aggressive medical management can reduce the incidence of cerebral
	infarction in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.
	DESIGN--Prospective, randomized, multicenter trial. SETTING--Thirty-nine
	clinical sites across the United States and Canada. PATIENTS--Between
	December 1987 and December 1993, a total of 1662 patients with asymptomatic
	carotid artery stenosis of 60\% or greater reduction in diameter
	were randomized; follow-up data are available on 1659. At baseline,
	recognized risk factors for stroke were similar between the two treatment
	groups. INTERVENTION--Daily aspirin administration and medical risk
	factor management for all patients; carotid endarterectomy for patients
	randomized to receive surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Initially,
	transient ischemic attack or cerebral infarction occurring in the
	distribution of the study artery and any transient ischemic attack,
	stroke, or death occurring in the perioperative period. In March
	1993, the primary outcome measures were changed to cerebral infarction
	occurring in the distribution of the study artery or any stroke or
	death occurring in the perioperative period. RESULTS--After a median
	follow-up of 2.7 years, with 4657 patient-years of observation, the
	aggregate risk over 5 years for ipsilateral stroke and any perioperative
	stroke or death was estimated to be 5.1\% for surgical patients and
	11.0\% for patients treated medically (aggregate risk reduction of
	53\% [95\% confidence interval, 22\% to 72\%]). CONCLUSION--Patients
	with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis of 60\% or greater reduction
	in diameter and whose general health makes them good candidates for
	elective surgery will have a reduced 5-year risk of ipsilateral stroke
	if carotid endarterectomy performed with less than 3\% perioperative
	morbidity and mortality is added to aggressive management of modifiable
	risk factors.},

	histology. DESIGN: European multicentre study (nine centres). MATERIAL
	AND METHODS: Clinical presentation and risk factors were recorded
	and preoperative ultrasound Duplex scanning with special emphasis
	on B-mode imaging studies was performed in 270 patients undergoing
	carotid endarterectomy. Perioperatively, macroscopic plaque features
	were evaluated and the removed specimens were analysed histologically
	for fibrous tissue, calcification and 'soft tissue' (primarily haemorrhage
	and lipid). RESULTS: Males had more soft tissue than females (p =
	0.0006), hypertensive patients less soft tissue than normotensive
	(p = 0.01) and patients with recent symptoms more soft tissue than
	patients with earlier symptoms (p = 0.004). There was no correlation
	between surface description on ultrasound images compared to the
	surface judged intraoperatively by the surgeon. Echogenicity on B-mode
	images was inversely related to soft tissue (p = 0.005) and calcification
	was directly related to echogenicity (p < 0.0001). Heterogeneous
	plaques contained more calcification than homogeneous (p = 0.003),
	however, there was no difference in content of soft tissue. CONCLUSION:
	Ultrasound B-mode characteristics are related to the histological
	composition of carotid artery plaques and to patient's history. These
	results may imply that patients with distant symptoms may be regarded
	and treated as asymptomatic patients whereas asymptomatic patients
	with echolucent plaques should be considered for carotid endarterectomy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. Without strong evidence of benefit, the use of carotid
	endarterectomy for prophylaxis against stroke rose dramatically until
	the mid-1980s, then declined. Our investigation sought to determine
	whether carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of stroke among patients
	with a recent adverse cerebrovascular event and ipsilateral carotid
	stenosis. METHODS. We conducted a randomized trial at 50 clinical
	centers throughout the United States and Canada, in patients in two
	predetermined strata based on the severity of carotid stenosis--30
	to 69 percent and 70 to 99 percent. We report here the results in
	the 659 patients in the latter stratum, who had had a hemispheric
	or retinal transient ischemic attack or a nondisabling stroke within
	the 120 days before entry and had stenosis of 70 to 99 percent in
	the symptomatic carotid artery. All patients received optimal medical
	care, including antiplatelet therapy. Those assigned to surgical
	treatment underwent carotid endarterectomy performed by neurosurgeons
	or vascular surgeons. All patients were examined by neurologists
	1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after entry and then every 4 months. End
	points were assessed by blinded, independent case review. No patient
	was lost to follow-up. RESULTS. Life-table estimates of the cumulative
	risk of any ipsilateral stroke at two years were 26 percent in the
	331 medical patients and 9 percent in the 328 surgical patients--an
	absolute risk reduction (+/- SE) 17 +/- 3.5 percent (P less than
	0.001). For a major or fatal ipsilateral stroke, the corresponding
	estimates were 13.1 percent and 2.5 percent--an absolute risk reduction
	of 10.6 +/- 2.6 percent (P less than 0.001). Carotid endarterectomy
	was still found to be beneficial when all strokes and deaths were
	included in the analysis (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Carotid
	endarterectomy is highly beneficial to patients with recent hemispheric
	and retinal transient ischemic attacks or nondisabling strokes and
	ipsilateral high-grade stenosis (70 to 99 percent) of the internal
	carotid artery.},
