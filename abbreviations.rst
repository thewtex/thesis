BSC
  *Backscatter coefficient*.  Differential scattering cross section per unit
  volume at a scattering angle of 180 degrees.  A quantity that describes how
  much energy gets returned to the transducer when performing pulse-echo
  imaging.

CCA
  *Common Carotid Artery*.  Artery that branches from the aorta on the left and
  the brachiocephalic artery on the right side that supplies the brain.

CEA
  *Carotid Endarterectomy*.  Surgery to remove plaque from the carotid through a
  longitudinal incision.

ECA
  *External Carotid Artery*.  Branches off CCA to supply the face.

FLAIR
  *Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery*.  MRI pulse sequence designed to
  suppress signal from fluid such as cerebrospinal fluid.

FPS
  *Frames per second*.

ICA
  *Internal Carotid Artery*.  Branches off CCA to supply the brain.

IVUS
  *Intravascular ultrasound*.  High frequency (high resolution) ultrasound
  performed with a transducer placed at the tip of a catheter that is inserted
  into the artery.

MMP
  *Matrix Metalloproteinase*.  Enzyme involved in breakdown of the extracellular
  matrix.

MRI
  *Magnetic resonance imaging*.  Imaging modality based on the magnetic behavior
  of water affected by its local tissue environment.

PFO
  *Patent Foramen Ovale*.  Right-to-left heart shunt that is of consequence of
  in-uteral development, which remains partially patent in a quarter of the
  population into adulthood.  Can be a source of emboli.

ROI
  *Region of interest*.

SRS
  *Strain Regularization Sigma*.  Parameter of the Bayesian regularization
  method is related to the distribution of expected strains in the image.

TIA
  *Transient ischemic attack."*  Brief episodes of focal loss of brain function
  due to ischemia [Whisnant1990]_.

TM phantom
  *Tissue mimicking phantom.*  Has similar physical properties as the target tissue in
  the phenomena being examined.  For instance, when examining mechanical
  phenomena, a TM phantom should have a similar elastic modulus.  When examining acoustic phenomena, a TM
  phantom should have similar speed of sound, attenuation, and backscatter
  properties.

UTC
  *Ultrasound Tissue Characterization*.  Imaging techniques that put greater
  emphasis on displaying parameters of the target tissue  instead of the machine
  used to generate the image.
