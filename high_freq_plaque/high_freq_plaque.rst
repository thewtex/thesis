High-frequency Plaque Characterization
======================================

High-frequency ultrasound imaging is useful for examining small objects -- it
has the advantage of high resolution at the expense of low penetration.  In this
chapter we explore new high frequency imaging techniques to interrogate the
excised plaques which result from endarterectomy.  Finally, we present initial
3D parametric images of the excised plaques.

Each
acquisition consists of 250 beam lines separated by approximately 60 μm, 2128
samples (3.9 mm), and up to 250 frames separated by 200 μm to 100 μm
depending on the length of the plaque specimen.  For the lengths of the plaques
we examined, which ranged from approximately 20 mm to 40 mm, this filled the
system limit on acquisition.  Resulting files are approximately 150 per
volumetric slice.  Three to five volumetric slices are required to encompass
the majority of an excised plaque's volume.  Some longer plaques may require
larger inter-frame spacing because of memory limitations, although the
resolution in the elevational direction is nominally 140 μm for the RMV710B
transducer.
