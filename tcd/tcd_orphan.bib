  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that transcranial
	Doppler embolic signal (ES) detection identifies an increased risk
	of ipsilateral carotid stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)
	in subjects with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis. METHODS: Subjects
	with duplex-determined 60\% to 99\% carotid stenosis, without other
	apparent cerebroembolic sources, underwent 6-monthly neurological
	assessment and 60-minute ES monitoring. ES positivity was defined
	as > or =1 ES detected in > or =1 study, ES negativity as no ES in
	any study, and consistent ES negativity as no ES in any study where
	> or =6 studies were performed. Rates of ipsilateral carotid stroke/TIA
	were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and correlated with ES
	status using odds ratios (ORs) and Cox proportional hazards regression
	analysis. RESULTS: A total of 202 subjects (138 male; mean age 74
	years; mean follow-up 34 months) were recruited. The average annual
	rate of ipsilateral carotid stroke/TIA was 3.1\%. A total of 231
	arteries were monitored at least once (mean 4.3 studies/artery).
	Six of 60 (10.0\%) ES-positive arteries had an ipsilateral carotid
	stroke/TIA compared with 12 of 171 (7.0\%) ES-negative arteries (OR,
	1.47; 95\% CI, 0.43, 4.48; P=0.624) and 2 of 41 (4.9\%) consistently
	ES-negative arteries (OR, 2.17; 95\% CI, 0.36, 22.90; P=0.59). Differences
	in survival free of ipsilateral carotid stroke/TIA according to ES
	status were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Although
	there were more ipsilateral carotid cerebrovascular events among
	ES-positive arteries, this was not statistically significant. Less
	labor-intensive techniques are required to make further study and
	clinical application practical.},

	of Emboli in Symptomatic carotid Stenosis) trial proved the effectiveness
	of the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin compared with aspirin
	alone in reducing presence and number of microembolic signals (MES)
	in patients with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis. The present
	study aimed at installing primary and secondary quality control measures
	in CARESS because MES evaluation relies on subjective judgment by
	human experts. METHODS: As primary quality control, centers participating
	in CARESS evaluated a reference digital audio tape (DAT) before the
	study containing both MES and artifacts. Interobserver agreement
	of classifying signals as MES was expressed as proportions of specific
	agreement of positive ratings (ps+/-values). For all DATs included
	in CARESS (n=300), online number of MES and off-line number of MES
	read by the central reader were compared using correlation coefficients.
	As secondary control, a sample of 16 of 300 DATs was cross-validated
	by another independent reader (post-trial validator). RESULTS: For
	the reference tape, the cumulative ps+/-value was 0.894 based on
	12 of 14 observers. Two observers with very different results improved
	after a training procedure. Agreement between post-trial validator
	and central reader was ps+=0.805, indicating very good agreement.
	Correlation between online evaluation and off-line evaluation of
	DATs was very good overall (cumulative rho=0.84; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
	Multicenter studies using MES as outcome parameter are feasible.
	However, primary and secondary quality control procedures are important.},

	stroke is limited. Symptomatic carotid stenosis patients are at high
	risk of early recurrent stroke. In this group, asymptomatic microembolic
	signals (MES), detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD),
	are markers of future stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA)
	risk. They offer a surrogate marker to evaluate antiplatelet therapy,
	but no multicenter study has evaluated the feasibility of this approach.
	METHODS AND RESULTS: Clopidogrel and Aspirin for Reduction of Emboli
	in Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis (CARESS) is a randomized, double-blind
	study in subjects with recently symptomatic > or =50\% carotid stenosis.
	Patients were screened with TCD, and if MES were detected, they were
	randomized to clopidogrel and aspirin or aspirin monotherapy. Repeated
	TCD recordings were made on days 2 and 7. MES were detected in 110
	of 230 patients by online analysis at baseline, of whom 107 were
	randomized. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed a significant reduction
	in the primary end point: 43.8\% of dual-therapy patients were MES
	positive on day 7, as compared with 72.7\% of monotherapy patients
	(relative risk reduction 39.8\%; 95\% CI, 13.8 to 58.0; P=0.0046).
	The secondary end point of MES frequency per hour was reduced (compared
	with baseline) by 61.4\% (95\% CI, 31.6 to 78.2; P=0.0013) in the
	dual-therapy group at day 7 and by 61.6\% (95\% CI, 34.9 to 77.4;
	P=0.0005) on day 2. There were 4 recurrent strokes and 7 TIAs in
	the monotherapy group versus no stroke and 4 TIAs in the dual-therapy
	group that were treatment emergent and ipsilateral to the qualifying
	carotid stenosis; 2 additional ipsilateral TIAs occurred before treatment
	started. MES frequency was greater in the 17 patients with recurrent
	ipsilateral events compared with the 90 without (mean+/-SD: 24.4+/-27.7
	versus 8.9+/-11.5 per hour; P=0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with
	recently symptomatic carotid stenosis, combination therapy with clopidogrel
	and aspirin is more effective than aspirin alone in reducing asymptomatic
	embolization. Doppler MES detection is a feasible method to evaluate
	the efficacy of antiplatelet therapy in multicenter studies.},

  abstract = {Transcranial Doppler is an innovative, flexible, accessible tool for
	the bedside monitoring of static and dynamic cerebral flow and treatment
	response. Introduced by Rune Aaslid in 1982, it has become indispensable
	in clinical practice. The main obstacle to ultrasound penetration
	of the skull is bone. Low frequencies, 1-2 MHz, reduce the attenuation
	of the ultrasound wave caused by bone. Transcranial Doppler also
	provides the advantage of acoustic windows representing specific
	points of the skull where the bone is thin enough to allow ultrasounds
	to penetrate. There are four acoustic windows: transtemporal, transorbital,
	suboccipital and retromandibular. The identification of each intracranial
	vessel is based on the following elements: (a) velocity and direction;
	(b) depth of signal capture; (c) possibility of following the vessel
	its whole length; (d) spatial relationship with other vessels; and
	(e) response to homolateral and contralateral carotid compression.
	The main fields of clinical application of transcranial Doppler are
	assessment of vasospasm, detection of stenosis of the intracranial
	arteries, evaluation of cerebrovascular autoregulation, non-invasive
	estimation of intracranial pressure, measure of effective downstream
	pressure and assessment of brain death. Mean flow velocity is directly
	proportional to flow and inversely proportional to the section of
	the vessel. Any circumstance that leads to a variation of one of
	these factors can thus affect mean velocity. The main pathological
	condition affecting flow velocity is the vasospasm. Vasospasm is
	a frequent complication of subarachnoid haemorrhage, it often remains
	clinically silent and the factors that make it symptomatic are largely
	unknown. Threshold velocities above which vasospasm comes into place
	are well defined as regards the median cerebral artery, while there
	is no consensus for the other vessels. Nevertheless, an increase
	in velocity alone is not sufficient to arrive at a diagnosis of vasospasm;
	a condition of hyperaemia also presents with an increase in flow
	velocity. The Lindegaard Index has therefore been introduced, which
	is defined by the ratio between the mean flow velocity in the median
	cerebral artery and the mean flow velocity in the internal carotid
	artery. Criteria for diagnosis of a stenosis >50\% of an intracranial
	vessel with transcranial Doppler include: (a) segmentary acceleration
	of flow velocity; (b) drop in velocity below the stenotic segment;
	(c) asymmetry; and (d) circumscribed flow disturbances (turbulence
	and musical murmur). The transcranial Doppler enables us to assess
	both components of self-regulation. The static component is measured
	by observing changes in flow velocity caused by pharmacologically
	induced episodes of hypertension and hypotension. The dynamic component
	of autoregulation can be measured using a method devised by Aaslid
	known as the 'cuff test'. A very effective and safe device for measuring
	cerebral autoregulation is the transient hyperaemic response test.
	This test is based on the compensatory vasodilatation of the arterioles,
	which occurs after brief compression of the common carotid. Csonyka
	proposed the following formula based on clinical observation for
	the calculation of cerebral perfusion pressure: CPP = MAP x FVd/FVm
	+ 14. Brain death is defined as the irreversible cessation of all
	functions of the whole brain. The clinical criteria are usually considered
	sufficient to establish a diagnosis of brain death; however, they
	might not be sufficient in patients who have been on sedatives or
	when there are ethical or legal controversies. Many authors have
	demonstrated the existence of a transcranial Doppler pattern, which
	is typical of brain death.},

	developed ischemic symptoms attributable to the stenosis (transient

  abstract = {Aging is associated with frontal subcortical microangiopathy and executive
	cognitive dysfunction, suggesting that elderly individuals may have
	impaired metabolic activation of cerebral blood flow to the frontal
	lobes. We used transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound to examine the
	cerebral blood flow response to executive control and visual tasks
	in the anterior and posterior cerebral circulations and to determine
	the effects of healthy aging on cerebral blood flow regulation during
	cognitive tasks. Continuous simultaneous anterior cerebral artery
	(ACA) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) blood flow velocities (BFVs)
	and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured in response to word
	stem completion (WSC) and a visual search (VS) task in 29 healthy
	subjects (14 young, 30+/-1.5 years; 15 old, 74+/-1.4 years). We found
	that: (1) ACA and PCA blood flow velocities are both significantly
	increased during WSC and VS cognitive tasks, (2) ACA and PCA activations
	were task specific in our young volunteers, with ACA>PCA BFV during
	the WSC task and PCA>ACA BFV during the VS task, (3) while healthy
	elderly subjects also had PCA>ACA BFV during the VS task, they did
	not have ACA>PCA activation during the WSC task, and (4) healthy
	elderly subjects tend to have overall greater increases in BFV during
	both cognitive tasks. We conclude that TCD can be used to monitor
	cerebrovascular hemodynamics during the performance of cognitive
	tasks. Our data suggest that there is differential blood flow increase
	in the ACA and PCA in young versus elderly subjects during cognitive
	tasks.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The value of carotid endarterectomy (CEA)
	depends on the safety of the operation. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound
	(TCD) was used to evaluate the possibilities of hypoperfusion, hyperperfusion,
	and embolization as causes of stroke and to evaluate the significance
	of Doppler microembolic signals (DMES). METHODS: Five hundred CEAs
	were monitored with TCD of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery
	during various phases of CEA to determine hemodynamic changes and
	incidence of DMES. Complications were graded according to their severity,
	and their probable cause was determined from TCD criteria and review
	of hospital charts. RESULTS: We observed 24 cerebrovascular complications
	(4.8\%), including 9 with transient ischemic attacks and 15 (3\%)
	with permanent deficits. Among all cerebrovascular complications,
	embolism was judged to be responsible in 13 (54\%; P < .02 compared
	with hypoperfusion), hyperperfusion in 7 (29\%; P < .14 compared
	with hypoperfusion), and hypoperfusion in 4 (17\%; P < .08 compared
	with embolism plus hyperperfusion). The surgeons responded to TCD
	information by several strategies depending on the TCD information.
	The incidence of permanent deficits diminished from 7\% in the first
	100 operations to 2\% in the last 400 (P < or = .01). Shunting was
	more strongly associated with cerebrovascular complications than
	nonshunting, but this difference was not significant (P = .24). Intraoperative
	prevalence of DMES was strongly associated with cerebrovascular complications
	(P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Embolism is the principal cause of cerebrovascular
	complications from CEA; hyperperfusion and hypoperfusion are also
	important causes. TCD provides information that allows prompt identification
	and treatment of these three major causes of stroke from this operation.
	The perioperative stroke rate can be reduced by appropriate measures,
	taken by the surgeons, based on findings of TCD monitoring.},
