  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that transcranial
	Doppler embolic signal (ES) detection identifies an increased risk
	of ipsilateral carotid stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)
	in subjects with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis. METHODS: Subjects
	with duplex-determined 60\% to 99\% carotid stenosis, without other
	apparent cerebroembolic sources, underwent 6-monthly neurological
	assessment and 60-minute ES monitoring. ES positivity was defined
	as > or =1 ES detected in > or =1 study, ES negativity as no ES in
	any study, and consistent ES negativity as no ES in any study where
	> or =6 studies were performed. Rates of ipsilateral carotid stroke/TIA
	were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and correlated with ES
	status using odds ratios (ORs) and Cox proportional hazards regression
	analysis. RESULTS: A total of 202 subjects (138 male; mean age 74
	years; mean follow-up 34 months) were recruited. The average annual
	rate of ipsilateral carotid stroke/TIA was 3.1\%. A total of 231
	arteries were monitored at least once (mean 4.3 studies/artery).
	Six of 60 (10.0\%) ES-positive arteries had an ipsilateral carotid
	stroke/TIA compared with 12 of 171 (7.0\%) ES-negative arteries (OR,
	1.47; 95\% CI, 0.43, 4.48; P=0.624) and 2 of 41 (4.9\%) consistently
	ES-negative arteries (OR, 2.17; 95\% CI, 0.36, 22.90; P=0.59). Differences
	in survival free of ipsilateral carotid stroke/TIA according to ES
	status were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Although
	there were more ipsilateral carotid cerebrovascular events among
	ES-positive arteries, this was not statistically significant. Less
	labor-intensive techniques are required to make further study and
	clinical application practical.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The CARESS (Clopidogrel and Aspirin for Reduction
	of Emboli in Symptomatic carotid Stenosis) trial proved the effectiveness
	of the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin compared with aspirin
	alone in reducing presence and number of microembolic signals (MES)
	in patients with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis. The present
	study aimed at installing primary and secondary quality control measures
	in CARESS because MES evaluation relies on subjective judgment by
	human experts. METHODS: As primary quality control, centers participating
	in CARESS evaluated a reference digital audio tape (DAT) before the
	study containing both MES and artifacts. Interobserver agreement
	of classifying signals as MES was expressed as proportions of specific
	agreement of positive ratings (ps+/-values). For all DATs included
	in CARESS (n=300), online number of MES and off-line number of MES
	read by the central reader were compared using correlation coefficients.
	As secondary control, a sample of 16 of 300 DATs was cross-validated
	by another independent reader (post-trial validator). RESULTS: For
	the reference tape, the cumulative ps+/-value was 0.894 based on
	12 of 14 observers. Two observers with very different results improved
	after a training procedure. Agreement between post-trial validator
	and central reader was ps+=0.805, indicating very good agreement.
	Correlation between online evaluation and off-line evaluation of
	DATs was very good overall (cumulative rho=0.84; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
	Multicenter studies using MES as outcome parameter are feasible.
	However, primary and secondary quality control procedures are important.},

  abstract = {Cerebral ischaemia, the most frequent serious complication of carotid
	endarterectomy (CEA), usually occurs in the early postoperative period
	and is often the result of thromboembolism. We hypothesized that
	the early postoperative detection of microembolic ultrasonic signals
	(MES) with transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) may be of value
	in identifying patients at risk of postoperative cerebral ischaemia
	and that the MES rate may be an important determinant in risk prediction.
	Sixty-five patients undergoing CEA were studied at intervals up to
	24 h postoperatively with TCD insonation of the middle cerebral artery
	ipsilateral to the operation side. Study design was open and prospective
	with blinded off-line analysis of MES counts. End-points were any
	focal ischaemic neurological deficit and/or death up to 30 days postoperatively.
	MES were detected in 69\% of cases during the first hour postoperatively
	with counts ranging from 0 to 212 MES/h (means 19 MES/h; SEM +2-
	4.5; median 4 MES/h). In seven cases (10.8\%) counts were > 50 MES/h.
	Five of these seven cases developed ischaemic neurological deficits
	in the territory of the insonated middle cerebral artery during the
	monitoring period. The positive predictive value of counts > 50 MES/h
	for cerebral ischaemia was 0.71. Frequent signals (> 50 MES/h) occur
	in approximately 10\% of cases in the early postoperative phase of
	CEA and are predictive for the development of ipsilateral focal cerebral
	ischaemia.},
