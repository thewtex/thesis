  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that transcranial
	Doppler embolic signal (ES) detection identifies an increased risk
	of ipsilateral carotid stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)
	in subjects with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis. METHODS: Subjects
	with duplex-determined 60\% to 99\% carotid stenosis, without other
	apparent cerebroembolic sources, underwent 6-monthly neurological
	assessment and 60-minute ES monitoring. ES positivity was defined
	as > or =1 ES detected in > or =1 study, ES negativity as no ES in
	any study, and consistent ES negativity as no ES in any study where
	> or =6 studies were performed. Rates of ipsilateral carotid stroke/TIA
	were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and correlated with ES
	status using odds ratios (ORs) and Cox proportional hazards regression
	analysis. RESULTS: A total of 202 subjects (138 male; mean age 74
	years; mean follow-up 34 months) were recruited. The average annual
	rate of ipsilateral carotid stroke/TIA was 3.1\%. A total of 231
	arteries were monitored at least once (mean 4.3 studies/artery).
	Six of 60 (10.0\%) ES-positive arteries had an ipsilateral carotid
	stroke/TIA compared with 12 of 171 (7.0\%) ES-negative arteries (OR,
	1.47; 95\% CI, 0.43, 4.48; P=0.624) and 2 of 41 (4.9\%) consistently
	ES-negative arteries (OR, 2.17; 95\% CI, 0.36, 22.90; P=0.59). Differences
	in survival free of ipsilateral carotid stroke/TIA according to ES
	status were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Although
	there were more ipsilateral carotid cerebrovascular events among
	ES-positive arteries, this was not statistically significant. Less
	labor-intensive techniques are required to make further study and
	clinical application practical.},
